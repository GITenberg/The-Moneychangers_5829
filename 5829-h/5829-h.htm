    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Reggie Mann, &ldquo;quite beside myself to meet this Lucy Dupree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you about her?&rdquo; asked Allan Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ollie's been telling everybody about her,&rdquo; said Reggie. &ldquo;It sounds really
      wonderful. But I fear he must have exaggerated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People seem to develop a tendency to exaggeration,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;when
      they talk about Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in quite a state about her,&rdquo; said Reggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allan Montague looked at him and smiled. There were no visible signs of
      agitation about Reggie. He had come to take Alice to church, and he was
      exquisitely groomed and perfumed, and wore a wonderful scarlet orchid in
      his buttonhole. Montague, lounging back in a big leather chair and
      watching him, smiled to himself at the thought that Reggie regarded Lucy
      as a new kind of flower, with which he might parade down the Avenue and
      attract attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she large or small?&rdquo; asked Reggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is about your size,&rdquo; said Montague,&mdash;which was very small
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice entered at this moment in a new spring costume. Reggie sprang to his
      feet, and greeted her with his inevitable effusiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he asked, &ldquo;Do you know her, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Lucy?&rdquo; asked Alice. &ldquo;I went to school with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Dupree's plantation was next to ours,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;We all grew
      up together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was hardly a day that I did not see her until she was married,&rdquo;
       said Alice. &ldquo;She was married at seventeen, you know&mdash;to a man much
      older than herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have never seen her since that,&rdquo; added the other. &ldquo;She has lived in
      New Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And only twenty-two now,&rdquo; exclaimed Reggie. &ldquo;All the wisdom of a widow
      and the graces of an ingénue!&rdquo; And he raised his hands with a gesture of
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she got money?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had enough for New Orleans,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I don't know about New
      York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; he said meditatively, &ldquo;there's plenty of money lying about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Alice away to her devotions, leaving Montague to the memories
      which the mention of Lucy Dupree awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allan Montague had been in love with Lucy a half a dozen times in his
      life; it had begun when she was a babe in arms, and continued
      intermittently until her marriage. Lucy was a beauty of the creole type,
      with raven-black hair and gorgeous colouring; and Allan carried with him
      everywhere the face of joy, with the quick, mobile features across which
      tears and laughter chased like April showers across the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was a tiny creature, as he had said, but she was a well-spring of
      abounding energy. She had been the life of a lonely household from the
      first hour, and all who came near her yielded to her spell. Allan
      remembered one occasion when he had entered the house and seen the grave
      and venerable chief justice of the State down upon his hands and knees,
      with Lucy on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a born actress, everybody said. When she was no more than four,
      she would lie in bed when she should have been asleep, and tell herself
      tragic stories to make her weep. Before long she had discovered several
      chests full of the clothes which her mother had worn in the days when she
      was a belle of the old plantation society; and then Lucy would have
      tableaus and theatricals, and would astonish all beholders in the role of
      an Oriental princess or a Queen of the Night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother had died when she was very young, and she had grown up with
      only her father for a companion. Judge Dupree was one of the rich men of
      the neighbourhood, and he lavished everything upon his daughter; but
      people had said that Lucy would suffer for the lack of a woman's care, and
      the prophecy had been tragically fulfilled. There had come a man, much
      older than herself, but with a glamour of romance about him; and the
      wonder of love had suddenly revealed itself to Lucy, and swept her away as
      no emotion had ever done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she disappeared, and Montague had never seen her again. He knew
      that she had gone to New Orleans to live, and he heard rumours that she
      was very unhappy, that her husband was a spendthrift and a rake. Scarcely
      a year after her marriage Montague heard the story of his death by an
      accident while driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard no more until a short time after his coming to New York, when
      the home papers had reported the death of Judge Dupree. And then a week or
      so ago had come a letter from Lucy, to his brother, Oliver Montague,
      saying that she was coming to New York, perhaps to live permanently, and
      asking him to meet her and to engage accommodations for her in some hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague wondered what she would be like when he saw her again. He
      wondered what five years of suffering and experience would have done for
      her; whether it would have weakened her enthusiasm and dried up her
      springs of joy. Lucy grown serious was something that was difficult for
      him to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then again would come a mood of doubt, when he distrusted the thrill
      which the memory of her brought. Would she be able to maintain her spell
      in competition with what life had brought him since?
    </p>
    <p>
      His revery was broken by Oliver, who came in to ask him if he wished to go
      to meet her. &ldquo;Those Southern trains are always several hours late,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I told my man to go over and 'phone me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to have her in charge,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;you had better see her
      first. Tell her I will come in the evening.&rdquo; And so he went to the great
      apartment hotel&mdash;the same to which Oliver had originally introduced
      him. And there was Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just the same. He could see it in an instant; there was the same
      joyfulness, the same eagerness; there was the same beauty, which had made
      men's hearts leap up. There was not a line of care upon her features&mdash;she
      was like a perfect flower come to its fulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to him with both her hands outstretched. &ldquo;Allan!&rdquo; she cried,
      &ldquo;Allan! I am so glad to see you!&rdquo; And she caught his hands in hers and
      stood and gazed at him. &ldquo;My, how big you have grown, and how serious!
      Isn't he splendid, Ollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver stood by, watching. He smiled drily. &ldquo;He is a trifle too epic for
      me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my, how wonderful it seems to see you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It makes me
      think of fifty things at once. We must sit down and have a long talk. It
      will take me all night to ask you all the questions I have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was in mourning for her father, but she had contrived to make her
      costume serve as a frame for her beauty. She seemed like a flaming ruby
      against a background of black velvet. &ldquo;Tell me how you have been,&rdquo; she
      rushed on. &ldquo;And what has happened to you up here? How is your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;she wants you to come around to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Lucy,&mdash;&ldquo;the first thing, before I go anywhere. And
      Mammy Lucy! How is Mammy Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is well,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She's beside herself to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her I am coming!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I would rather see Mammy Lucy than the
      Brooklyn Bridge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him to a seat, placed herself opposite him, devouring him with her
      eyes. &ldquo;It makes me seem like a girl again to see you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you count yourself aged?&rdquo; asked Montague, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I feel old,&rdquo; said Lucy, with a sudden look of fear,&mdash;&ldquo;you have
      no idea, Allan. But I don't want anybody to know about it!&rdquo; And then she
      cried, eagerly, &ldquo;Do you remember the swing in the orchard? And do you
      remember the pool where the big alligator lived? And the persimmons? And
      Old Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allan Montague remembered all these things; in the course of the half hour
      that followed he remembered pretty nearly all the exciting adventures
      which he and Oliver and Lucy had had since Lucy was old enough to walk.
      And he told her the latest news about all their neighbours, and about all
      the servants whom she remembered. He told her also about his father's
      death, and how the house had been burned, and how they had sold the
      plantation and come North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are you doing, Allan?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am practising law,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm not making a fortune, but I'm
      managing to pay my bills. That is more than some other people do in this
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should imagine it,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;With all that row of shops on Fifth
      Avenue! Oh, I know I shall spend all that I own in the first week. And
      this hotel&mdash;why, it's perfectly frightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver has told you the prices, has he?&rdquo; said Montague, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken my breath away,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;How am I ever to manage such
      things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to settle that with him,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;He has taken
      charge, and he doesn't want me to interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want your advice,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;You are a business man, and Ollie
      never was anything but a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ollie has learned a good deal since he has been in New York,&rdquo; the other
      responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you my side of the case very quickly,&rdquo; he went on after a
      moment's pause. &ldquo;He brought me here, and persuaded me that this was how I
      ought to live if I wanted to get into Society. I tried it for a while, but
      I found that I did not like the things I had to do, and so I quit. You
      will find us in an apartment a couple of blocks farther from Fifth Avenue,
      and we only pay about one-tenth as much for it. And now, whether you
      follow me or Ollie depends upon whether you want to get into Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy wrinkled her brows in thought. &ldquo;I didn't come to New York to bury
      myself in a boarding-house,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do want to meet people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;Oliver knows a lot of them, and he will introduce
      you. Perhaps you will like them&mdash;I don't know. I am sure you won't
      have any difficulty in making them like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;You are as ingenuous as ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to say anything to spoil your pleasure,&rdquo; said the other.
      &ldquo;You will find out about matters for yourself. But I feel like telling you
      this&mdash;don't you be too ingenuous. You can't trust people quite so
      freely here as you did at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Ollie has already been lecturing me. I had no
      idea it was such a serious matter to come to New York. I told him that
      widows were commonly supposed to know how to take care of themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a rather bad time of it myself, getting adjusted to things,&rdquo; said
      Montague, smiling. &ldquo;So you must make allowances for my forebodings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've told Lucy a little about it,&rdquo; put in Oliver, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me a most fascinating love story!&rdquo; said Lucy, gazing at him with
      a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. &ldquo;I shall certainly look out for the
      dazzling Mrs. Winnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may meet her to-morrow night,&rdquo; put in Oliver. &ldquo;You are invited to
      dinner at Mrs. Billy Alden's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read about Mrs. Billy in the newspapers,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;But I never
      expected to meet her. How in the world has Oliver managed to jump so into
      the midst of things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver undertook to explain; and Montague sat by, smiling to himself over
      his brother's carefully expurgated account of his own social career.
      Oliver had evidently laid his plans to take charge of Lucy, and to escort
      her to a high seat upon the platform of Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, all this will cost so much money!&rdquo; Lucy protested. &ldquo;And I
      don't want to have to marry one of these terrible millionaires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Montague abruptly. &ldquo;Have you got an office somewhere down
      town?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And may I come to-morrow, and see you, and get you to
      be my business adviser? Old Mr. Holmes is dead, you know. He used to be
      father's lawyer, and he knew all about my affairs. He never thought it
      worth while to explain anything to me, so now I don't know very well what
      I have or what I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do all I can to help you,&rdquo; Montague answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must be very severe with me,&rdquo; Lucy continued, &ldquo;and not let me
      spend too much money, or make any blunders. That was the way Mr. Holmes
      used to do, and since he is dead, I have positively been afraid to trust
      myself about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am to play that part for you,&rdquo; said Montague, laughing, &ldquo;I am afraid
      we'll very soon clash with my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague had very little confidence in his ability to fill the part. As he
      watched Lucy, he had a sense of tragedy impending. He knew enough to feel
      sure that Lucy was not rich, according to New York standards of wealth;
      and he felt that the lure of the city was already upon her. She was
      dazzled by the vision of automobiles and shops and hotels and theatres,
      and all the wonders which these held out to her. She had come with all her
      generous enthusiasms; and she was hungry with a terrible hunger for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had been through the mill, and he saw ahead so clearly that it
      was impossible for him not to try to guide her, and to save her from the
      worst of her mistakes. Hence arose a strange relationship between them;
      from the beginning Lucy made him her confidant, and told him all her
      troubles. To be sure, she never took his advice; she would say, with her
      pretty laugh, that she did not want him to keep her out of trouble, but
      only to sympathise with her afterwards. And Montague followed her; he told
      himself again and again that there was no excuse for Lucy; but all the
      while he was making excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went over the next morning to see Oliver's mother, and Mammy Lucy, who
      had been named after her grandmother. Then in the afternoon she went
      shopping with Alice&mdash;declaring that it was impossible for her to
      appear anywhere in New York until she had made herself &ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; And
      then in the evening Montague called for her, and took her to Mrs. Billy
      Alden's Fifth Avenue palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way he beguiled the time by telling her about the terrible Mrs.
      Billy and her terrible tongue; and about the war between the great lady
      and her relatives, the Wallings. &ldquo;You must not be surprised,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if
      she pins you in a corner and asks all about you. Mrs. Billy is a
      privileged character, and the conventions do not apply to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague had come to take the Alden magnificence as a matter of course by
      this time, but he felt Lucy thrill with excitement at the vision of the
      Doge's palace, with its black marble carvings and its lackeys in scarlet
      and gold. Then came Mrs. Billy herself, resplendent in dark purple
      brocade, with a few ropes of pearls flung about her neck. She was almost
      tall enough to look over the top of Lucy's head, and she stood away a
      little so as to look at her comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to have Mrs. Winnie here for you,&rdquo; she said to Montague, as she
      placed him at her right hand. &ldquo;But she was not able to come, so you will
      have to make out with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you many more beauties like that down in Mississippi?&rdquo; she asked,
      when they were seated. &ldquo;If so, I don't see why you came up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like her, do you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her looks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Billy. &ldquo;Has she got any sense? It is quite
      impossible to believe that she's a widow. She needs someone to take care
      of her just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will recommend her to your favour,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I have been telling
      her about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you told her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Billy, serenely,&mdash;&ldquo;that I win
      too much money at bridge, and drink Scotch at dinner?&rdquo; Then, seeing
      Montague blush furiously, she laughed. &ldquo;I know it is true. I have caught
      you thinking it half a dozen times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she reached out for the decanter which the butler had just placed in
      front of her, and proceeded to help herself to her opening glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague told her all about Lucy; and, in the meantime, he watched the
      latter, who sat near the centre of the table, talking with Stanley Ryder.
      Montague had played bridge with this man once or twice at Mrs. Winnie's,
      and he thought to himself that Lucy could hardly have met a man who would
      embody in himself more of the fascinations of the Metropolis. Ryder was
      president of the Gotham Trust Company, an institution whose magnificent
      marble front was one of the sights of Fifth Avenue. He was a man a trifle
      under fifty, tall and distinguished-looking, with an iron-grey mustache,
      and the manners of a diplomat. He was not only a banker, he was also a man
      of culture; he had run away to sea in his youth, and he had travelled in
      every country of the world. He was also a bit of an author, in an amateur
      way, and if there was any book which he had not dipped into, it was not a
      book of which one would be apt to hear in Society. He could talk upon any
      subject, and a hostess who could secure Stanley Ryder for one of her
      dinner-parties generally counted upon a success. &ldquo;He doesn't go out much,
      these busy days,&rdquo; said Mrs. Billy. &ldquo;But I told him about your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now and then the conversation at the table would become general, and
      Montague noticed that it was always Ryder who led. His flashes of wit shot
      back and forth across the table; and those who matched themselves against
      him seldom failed to come off the worse. It was an unscrupulous kind of
      wit, dazzling and dangerous. Ryder was the type of man one met now and
      then in Society, who had adopted radical ideas for the sake of being
      distinguished. It was a fine thing for a man who had made a brilliant
      success in a certain social environment to shatter in his conversation all
      the ideals and conventions of that environment, and thus to reveal how
      little he really cared for the success which he had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very entertaining at a dinner-party; but Montague thought to
      himself with a smile how far was Stanley Ryder from the type of person one
      imagined as the head of an enormous and flourishing bank. When they had
      adjourned to the drawing-room, he capped the climax of the incongruity by
      going to the piano and playing a movement from some terrible Russian
      suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards Montague saw him stroll off to the conservatory with Lucy
      Dupree. There were two people too many for bridge, and that was a good
      excuse; but none the less Montague felt restless during the hours that he
      sat at table and let Mrs. Billy win his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the ordeal was over and the party had broken up, he found his friend
      sitting by the side of the fountain in Mrs. Billy's conservatory, gazing
      fixedly in front of her, while Ryder at her side was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You met an interesting man,&rdquo; he said, when they had got settled in the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the most extraordinary men I ever met,&rdquo; said Lucy, quickly. &ldquo;I
      wish that you would tell me about him. Do you know him well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard him talk some, and I know him in a business way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he so very rich?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a few millions,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And I suppose he is turning them over
      very rapidly. People say that he is a daring speculator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A speculator!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy. &ldquo;Why, I thought that he was the president
      of a bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have been in New York awhile,&rdquo; said Montague, with a smile, &ldquo;you
      will realise that there is nothing incompatible in the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was silent, a little staggered at the remark. &ldquo;I am told,&rdquo; Montague
      added, with a smile, &ldquo;that even Ryder's wife won't keep her money in the
      Gotham Trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague had not anticipated the effect of this remark. Lucy gave a sudden
      start. &ldquo;His wife!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Didn't you know that he was married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lucy, in a low voice. &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Finally she asked, &ldquo;Why was not his wife invited
      to the dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seldom go out together,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they separated?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a new and fashionable kind of separation,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;They
      live in opposite sides of a large mansion, and meet on formal occasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a woman is she?&rdquo; asked Lucy,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about her,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence again. Finally Montague said, &ldquo;There is no cause to be
      sorry for him, you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lucy touched his hand lightly with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Allan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don't worry. I am not apt to make
      the same mistake twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Montague that there was nothing to be said after that.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lucy wanted to come down to Montague's office to talk business with him;
      but he would not put her to that trouble, and called the next morning at
      her apartment before he went down town. She showed him all her papers; her
      father's will, with a list of his property, and also the accounts of Mr.
      Holmes, and the rent-roll of her properties in New Orleans. As Montague
      had anticipated, Lucy's affairs had not been well managed, and he had many
      matters to look into and many questions to ask. There were a number of
      mortgages on real estate and buildings, and, on the other hand, some of
      Lucy's own properties were mortgaged, a state of affairs which she was not
      able to explain. There were stocks in several industrial companies, of
      which Montague knew but little. Last and most important of all, there was
      a block of five thousand shares in the Northern Mississippi Railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all about that, at any rate,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Have you sold your own
      holdings yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Father wished me to keep the agreement as long as
      the others did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am free to sell mine, am I not?&rdquo; asked Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should certainly advise you to sell it,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;But I am
      afraid it will not be easy to find a purchaser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Northern Mississippi was a railroad with which Montague had grown up,
      so to speak; there was never a time in his recollection when the two
      families had not talked about it. It ran from Atkin to Opala, a distance
      of about fifty miles, connecting at the latter point with one of the main
      lines of the State. It was an enterprise which Judge Dupree had planned,
      as a means of opening up a section of country in the future of which he
      had faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been undertaken at a time when distrust of Wall Street was very
      keen in that neighbourhood; and Judge Dupree had raised a couple of
      million dollars among his own friends and neighbours, adding another
      half-million of his own, with a gentlemen's agreement among all of them
      that the road would not ask favours of Northern capitalists, and that its
      stock should never be listed on the Exchanges. The first president had
      been an uncle of Lucy's, and the present holder of the office was an old
      friend of the family's.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sectional pride which had raised the capital could not furnish the
      traffic. The towns which Judge Dupree had imagined did not materialise,
      and the little railroad did not keep pace with the progress of the time.
      For the last decade or so its properties had been depreciating and its
      earnings falling off, and it had been several years since Montague had
      drawn any dividends upon the fifty thousand dollars' worth of stock for
      which his father had paid par value.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reminded, as he talked about all this with Lucy, of a project which
      had been mooted some ten or twelve years ago, to extend the line from
      Atkin so as to connect with the plant of the Mississippi Steel Company,
      and give that concern a direct outlet toward the west. The Mississippi
      Steel Company had one of the half dozen largest plate and rail mills in
      the country, and the idea of directing even a small portion of its
      enormous freight was one which had incessantly tantalised the minds of the
      directors of the Northern Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had gone so far as to conduct a survey, and to make a careful
      estimate of the cost of the proposed extension. Montague knew about this,
      because it had chanced that he, together with Lucy's brother, who was now
      in California, had spent part of his vacation on a hunting trip, during
      which they had camped near the surveying party. The proposed line had to
      find its way through the Talula swamps, and here was where the uncertainty
      of the project came in. There were a dozen routes proposed, and Montague
      remembered how he had sat by the campfire one evening, and got into
      conversation with one of the younger men of the party, and listened to his
      grumbling about the blundering of the survey. It was his opinion that the
      head-surveyor was incompetent, that he was obstinately rejecting the best
      routes in favour of others which were almost impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had taken this gossip to his father, but he did not know whether
      his father had ever looked into the matter. He only knew that when the
      project for the proposed extension had been brought up at a stockholders'
      meeting, the cost of the work was found so great that it was impossible to
      raise the money. A proposal to go to the Mississippi Steel Company was
      voted down, because Mississippi Steel was in the hands of Wall Street men;
      and neither Judge Dupree nor General Montague had realised at that time
      the hopelessness of the plight of the little railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these matters were brought up in the conversation between Lucy and
      Montague. There was no reason, he assured her, why they should still hold
      on to their stock; if, by the proposed extension, or by any other plan,
      new capitalists could make a success of the company, it would be well to
      make some combination with them, or, better yet, to sell out entirely.
      Montague promised that he would take the matter in hand and see what he
      could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought, as he went down town, was of Jim Hegan. &ldquo;Come and see
      me sometime,&rdquo; Hegan had said, and Montague had never accepted the
      invitation. The Northern Mississippi would, of course, be a mere bagatelle
      to a man like Hegan, but who could tell what new plans he might be able to
      fit it into? Montague knew by the rumours in the street that the great
      financier had sold out all his holdings in two or three of his most
      important ventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went at once to Hegan's office, in the building of one of the great
      insurance companies downtown. He made his way through corridors of marble
      to a gate of massively ornamented bronze, behind which stood a huge
      guardian in uniform, also massively ornamented. Montague generally passed
      for a big man, but this personage made him feel like an office-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Hegan in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call by appointment?&rdquo; was the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not precisely,&rdquo; said Montague, producing a card. &ldquo;Will you kindly send
      this to Mr. Hegan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Mr. Hegan personally?&rdquo; the man demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Montague answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other had made no sign, as far as Montague could make out, but at this
      moment a dapper young secretary made his appearance from the doors behind
      the gate. &ldquo;Would you kindly state the business upon which you wish to see
      Mr. Hegan?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see Mr. Hegan personally,&rdquo; Montague answered, with just a
      trifle of asperity, &ldquo;If you will kindly take in this card, it will be
      sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He submitted with what grace he could to a swift inspection at the
      secretary's hands, wondering, in the meantime, if his new spring overcoat
      was sufficiently up-to-date to entitle him, in the secretary's judgment,
      to be a friend of the great man within. Finally the man disappeared with
      the card, and half a minute later came back, smiling effusively. He
      ushered Montague into a huge office with leather-cushioned chairs large
      enough to hold several people each, and too large for any one person to be
      comfortable in. There was a map of the continent upon the wall, across
      which Jim Hegan's railroads stretched like scarlet ribbons. There were
      also heads of bison and reindeer, which Hegan had shot himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had to wait only a minute or two, and then he was escorted
      through a chain of rooms, and came at last to the magnate's inner sanctum.
      This was plain, with an elaborate and studied plainness, and Jim Hegan sat
      in front of a flat mahogany desk which had not a scrap of paper anywhere
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as the other came in, stretching out his huge form. &ldquo;How do you
      do, Mr. Montague?&rdquo; he said, and shook hands. Then he sat down in his
      chair, and settled back until his head rested on the back, and bent his
      great beetling brows, and gazed at his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time that Montague had met Hegan they had talked about horses,
      and about old days in Texas; but Montague was wise enough to realise that
      this had been in the evening. &ldquo;I have come on a matter of business, Mr.
      Hegan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I will be as brief as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A course of action which I do my best to pardon,&rdquo; was the smiling reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to propose to you to interest yourself in the affairs of the
      Northern Mississippi Railroad,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Northern Mississippi?&rdquo; said Hegan, knitting his brows. &ldquo;I have never
      heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't imagine that many people have,&rdquo; the other answered, and went on
      to tell the story of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have five hundred shares of the stock myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it has
      been in my family for a long time, and I am perfectly satisfied to let it
      stay there. I am not making this proposition on my own account, but for a
      client who has a block of five thousand shares. I have here the annual
      reports of the road for several years, and some other information about
      its condition. My idea was that you might care to take the road, and make
      the proposed extension to the works of the Mississippi Steel Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mississippi Steel!&rdquo; exclaimed Hegan. He had evidently heard of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago did you say it was that this plan was looked into?&rdquo; he
      asked. And Montague told him the story of the survey, and what he himself
      had heard about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds curious,&rdquo; said Hegan, and bent his brows, evidently in deep
      thought. &ldquo;I will look into the matter,&rdquo; he said, finally. &ldquo;I have no plans
      of my own that would take me into that neighbourhood, but it may be
      possible that I can think of someone who would be interested. Have you any
      idea what your client wants for the thousand shares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My client has put the matter into my hands,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The matter was
      only broached to me this morning, and I shall have to look further into
      the condition of the road. I should advise her to accept a fair offer&mdash;say
      seventy-five per cent of the par value of the stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can talk about that later,&rdquo; said Hegan, &ldquo;if I can find the man for
      you.&rdquo; And Montague shook hands with him and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in on his way home in the evening to tell Lucy about the result
      of his interview. &ldquo;We shall hear from him soon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't imagine
      that Hegan is a man who takes long to make up his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My prayers will be with him,&rdquo; said Lucy, with a laugh. Then she added, &ldquo;I
      suppose I shall see you Friday night at Mr. Harvey's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't come out until Saturday afternoon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am very busy
      these days, working on a case. But I try to find time to get down to
      Siegfried Harvey's; I seem to get along with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me he goes in for horses,&rdquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a splendid stable,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good of Ollie to bring him round,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have certainly
      jumped into the midst of things. What do you think I'm going to do
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been invited to see Mr. Waterman's art gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan Waterman's!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Alden's brother asked me. He knows him, and got me the invitation.
      Wouldn't you like to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be busy in court all day to-morrow,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;But I'd like
      to see the collection. I understand it's a wonderful affair,&mdash;the old
      man has spent all his spare time at it. You hear fabulous estimates of
      what it's cost him&mdash;four or five millions at the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why in the world does he hide it in a studio way up the Hudson?&rdquo;
       cried Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Just a whim,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He didn't
      collect it for other people's pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long as he lets me see it, I can't complain,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;There
      are so many things to see in this city, I am sure I shall be busy for a
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get tired before you have seen half of them,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;Everybody does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Mr. Waterman?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never met him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have seen him a couple of times.&rdquo; And
      Montague went on to tell her of the occasion in the Millonaires' Club,
      when he had seen the Croesus of Wall Street surrounded by an attending
      throng of &ldquo;little millionaires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shan't meet him,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I know I should be frightened to
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he can be charming when he wants to,&rdquo; replied Montague. &ldquo;The
      ladies are fond of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday afternoon, when Montague went down to Harvey's Long Island
      home, his brother met him at the ferry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; he began, immediately, &ldquo;did you know that Lucy had come down here
      with Stanley Ryder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague. &ldquo;Is Ryder down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got Harvey to invite him,&rdquo; Oliver replied. &ldquo;And I know it was for no
      reason in the world but to be with Lucy. He took her out in his
      automobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was dumfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never hinted it to me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver, &ldquo;I wonder if that fellow is going after Lucy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague stood for some time, lost in sombre thought. &ldquo;I don't think it
      will do him much good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lucy knows too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy has never met a man like Stanley Ryder!&rdquo; declared the other. &ldquo;He has
      spent all his life hunting women, and she is no match for him at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about him?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What don't I know about him!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;He was in love with
      Betty Wyman once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;and she told me all about it. He has as many tricks
      as a conjurer. He has read a lot of New Thought stuff, and he talks about
      his yearning soul, and every woman he meets is his affinity. And then
      again, he is a free thinker, and he discourses about liberty and the
      rights of women. He takes all the moralities and shuffles them up, until
      you'd think the noblest role a woman could play is that of a married man's
      mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague could not forbear to smile. &ldquo;I have known you to shuffle the
      moralities now and then yourself, Ollie,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's all right,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;But this is Lucy. And
      somebody's got to talk to her about Stanley Ryder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; Montague answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Lucy in a cosy corner of the library when he came down to dinner.
      She was full of all the wonderful things that she had seen in Dan
      Waterman's art gallery. &ldquo;And Allan,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what do you think, I
      met him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was there the whole afternoon!&rdquo; declared Lucy. &ldquo;And he never did a
      thing but be nice to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn't find him so terrible as you expected,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was perfectly charming,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;He showed me his whole collection
      and told me the history of the different paintings, and stories about how
      he got them. I never had such an experience in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can be an interesting man when he chooses,&rdquo; Montague responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is marvellous!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You look at that lean figure, and the
      wizened-up old hawk's face, with the white hair all round it, and you'd
      think that he was in his dotage. But when he talks&mdash;I don't wonder
      men obey him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They obey him!&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;No mistake about that! There is not a man
      in Wall Street who could live for twenty-four hours if old Dan Waterman
      went after him in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world does he do it?&rdquo; asked Lucy. &ldquo;Is he so enormously rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the money he owns,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;it's what he controls. He
      is master of the banks; and no man can take a step in Wall Street without
      his knowing it if he wants to. And he can break a man's credit; he can
      have all his loans called. He can swing the market so as to break a man.
      And then, think of his power in Washington! He uses the Treasury as if it
      were one of his branch offices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems frightful,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;And that old man&mdash;over eighty! I'm
      glad that I met him, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, seeing Stanley Ryder in the doorway. He was evidently looking
      for her. He took her in to dinner; and every now and then, when Montague
      stole a glance at her, he saw that Ryder was monopolising her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they adjourned to the music-room, and Ryder played a couple
      of Chopin's Nocturnes. He never took his eyes from Lucy's face while he
      was playing. &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; remarked Betty Wyman in Montague's hearing, &ldquo;the
      way Stanley Ryder makes love at the piano is positively indecent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague dodged several invitations to play cards, and deliberately placed
      himself at Lucy's side for the evening. And when at last Stanley Ryder had
      gone away in disgust to the smoking-room, he turned to her and said,
      &ldquo;Lucy, you must let me speak to you about this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind your speaking to me, Allan,&rdquo; she said; with a feeble attempt
      at a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must pay attention to me,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You really don't know
      the sort of man you are dealing with, or what people think about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat in silence, biting her lip nervously, while Montague told her, as
      plainly as he could, what Ryder's reputation was. All that she could
      answer was, &ldquo;He is such an interesting man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many interesting men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but you will never meet them
      if you get people talking about you like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy clasped her hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I did my best to persuade him not to come out
      here. And you are right. I will do what you say&mdash;I will have nothing
      to do with him, honestly. You shall see! It's his own fault that he came,
      and he can find somebody else to entertain him while he's here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that you would tell him plainly, Lucy,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Never mind
      if he gets angry. Make him understand you&mdash;once for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;I will!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Montague judged that she carried out her promise quickly, for the rest
      of the evening Ryder gave to entertaining the company. About midnight
      Montague chanced to look into the library, and he saw the president of the
      Gotham Trust in the midst of a group which was excitedly discussing
      divorce. &ldquo;Marriage is a sin for which the church refuses absolution!&rdquo; he
      heard Stanley Ryder exclaiming.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days after these incidents, Montague was waiting for a friend who
      was to come to dinner at his hotel. He was sitting in the lobby reading a
      paper, and he noticed an elderly gentleman with a grey goatee and rather
      florid complexion who passed down the corridor before him. A minute or two
      later he happened to glance up, and he caught this gentleman's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter started, and a look of amazement came over his face. He came
      forward, saying, &ldquo;I beg pardon, but is not this Allan Montague?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Montague, looking at him in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't remember me, do you?&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess that I do not,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Colonel Cole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Montague only knitted his brows in greater perplexity. &ldquo;Colonel Cole?&rdquo;
       he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were too young to remember me,&rdquo; the other said. &ldquo;I have been at your
      house a dozen times. I was in your father's brigade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague. &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mention it, don't mention it,&rdquo; said the other, taking a seat beside
      him. &ldquo;It was really extraordinary that I should recall you. And how is
      your brother? Is he in New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your mother? She is still living, I trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She is in this hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really an extraordinary pleasure!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;I did not
      think I knew a soul in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are visiting here?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the West,&rdquo; said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is curious how things follow out,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause. &ldquo;I was
      thinking about your father only this very day. I had a proposal from
      someone who wanted to buy some stock that I have&mdash;in the Northern
      Mississippi Railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague gave a start. &ldquo;You don't mean it!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Your father persuaded me to take some of the
      stock, away back in the old days. And I have had it ever since. I had
      forgotten all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague smiled. &ldquo;When you have disposed of yours,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you might
      refer your party to me. I know of some more that is for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;But I fancy it won't fetch much now.
      I don't remember receiving any dividends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. &ldquo;It is a curious coincidence,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I, too,
      have been thinking about the railroad. My friend, Mrs. Taylor, has just
      come up from New Orleans. She used to be Lucy Dupree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel strove to recall. &ldquo;Dupree?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Dupree's daughter,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;His brother, John Dupree, was
      the first president of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;Of course, of course! I remember the Judge
      now. Your father told me he had taken quite a lot of the stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was the prime mover in the enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was that other gentleman?&rdquo; said the Colonel, racking his brains.
      &ldquo;The one who used to be so much in his house, and was so much interested
      in him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Mr. Lee Gordon?&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think that was the name,&rdquo; the other replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my father's cousin,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;He put so much money into the
      road that the family has been poor ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an unfortunate venture,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;It is too bad some of
      our big capitalists don't take it up and do something with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my idea,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I have broached it to one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;Possibly that is where my offer came from.
      Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Jim Hegan,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Hegan would do his
      negotiating through an agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me give you my card,&rdquo; said the Colonel, after a pause. &ldquo;It is
      possible that I may be able to interest someone in the matter myself. I
      have friends who believe in the future of the South. How many shares do
      you suppose you could get me, and what do you suppose they would cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague got out a pencil and paper, and proceeded to recall as well as he
      could the location of the various holdings of Northern Mississippi. He and
      his new acquaintance became quite engrossed in the subject, and they
      talked it out from many points of view. By the time that Montague's friend
      arrived, the Colonel was in possession of all the facts, and he promised
      that he would write in a very few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, after dinner, Montague went upstairs and joined his mother. &ldquo;I
      met an old friend of father's this evening,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Cole,&rdquo; he said, and Mrs. Montague looked blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Cole?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was the name,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Here is his card,&rdquo; and he took
      it out. &ldquo;Henry W. Cole, Seattle, Washington,&rdquo; it read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never heard of him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague. &ldquo;Why, he has been at the house a
      dozen times, and he knew father and Cousin Lee and Judge Dupree and
      everyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Montague only shook her head. &ldquo;He may have been at the house,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;but I am sure that I was never introduced to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague thought that it was strange, but he would never have given
      further thought to the matter, had it not been for something which
      occurred the next morning. He went to the office rather early, on account
      of important work which he had to get ready. He was the first to arrive,
      and he found the scrub-woman who cleaned the office just taking her
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had never occurred to Montague before that such a person existed; and
      he turned in some surprise when she spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But there is something I have to tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is someone trying to find out about you,&rdquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but there was a man came here
      this morning, very early, and he offered me money, sir, and he wanted me
      to save him all the papers that I took out of your scrap basket, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague caught his breath. &ldquo;Papers out of my scrap basket!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;It is done now and then, sir,&mdash;we learn
      of such things, you know. And we are poor women,&mdash;they don't pay us
      very well. But you are a gentleman, sir, and I told him I would have
      nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a looking man was he?&rdquo; Montague demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a dark chap, sir,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;a sort of Jew like. He will
      maybe come back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague took out his purse and gave the woman a bill; and she stammered
      her thanks and went off with her pail and broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut the door and went and sat down at his desk, and stared in front of
      him, gasping, &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly he struck his knee with an exclamation of rage. &ldquo;I told him
      everything that I knew! Everything! He hardly had to ask me a question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But then again, wonder drowned every other emotion in him. &ldquo;What in the
      world can he have wanted to know? And who sent him? What can it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back over his talk with the old gentleman from Seattle, trying to
      recall exactly what he had told, and what use the other could have made of
      the information. But he could not think very steadily, for his mind kept
      jumping back to the thought of Jim Hegan.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be but one explanation of all this. Jim Hegan had set
      detectives upon him! Nobody else knew anything about the Northern
      Mississippi Railroad, or wanted to know about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Hegan! And Montague had met him socially at an entertainment&mdash;at
      Mrs. de Graffenried's! He had met him as one gentleman meets another, had
      shaken hands with him, had gone and talked with him freely and frankly!
      And then Hegan had sent a detective to worm his secrets from him, and had
      even tried to get at the contents of his trash basket!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one resort that Montague could think of, in a case so
      perplexing. He sat down and wrote a note to his friend Major Venable, at
      the Millionaires' Club, saying that he was coming there to dinner, and
      would like to have the Major's company. And two or three hours later, when
      sufficient time had elapsed for the Major to have had his shave and his
      coffee and his morning newspaper, he rang for a messenger and sent the
      note.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major's reply was prompt. He had no engagement, and his stores of
      information and advice were at Montague's service. But his gout was bad,
      and his temper atrocious, and Montague must be warned in advance that his
      doctors permitted him neither mushrooms nor meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It always seemed to Montague that it could not be possible for a human
      face to wear a brighter shade of purple than the Major's; yet every time
      he met him, it seemed to him that the purple was a shade brighter. And it
      spread farther with every step the Major took. He growled and grumbled,
      and swore tremendous oaths under his breath, and the way the headwaiter
      and all his assistants scurried about the dining-room of the Club was a
      joy to the beholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague waited until the old gentleman had obtained his usual dry
      Martini, and until he had solved the problem of satisfying his appetite
      and his doctor. And then he told of his extraordinary experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure that you could explain it, if anybody could,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is there to explain?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;It simply means that Jim
      Hegan is interested in your railroad. What more could you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he sent a detective after me!&rdquo; gasped Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's all right,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;It is done every day. There are a
      half dozen big agencies that do nothing else. You are lucky if he hasn't
      had your telephone tapped, and read your telegrams and mail before you saw
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague stared at him aghast. &ldquo;A man like Jim Hegan!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And
      to a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend?&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Pshaw! A man doesn't do business with
      friends. And, besides, Jim Hegan probably never knew anything about it. He
      turned the whole matter over to some subordinate, and told him to look it
      up, and he'll never give another thought to it until the facts are laid
      upon his desk. Some one of his men set to work, and he was a little clumsy
      about it&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did he want to know about all my family affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he wanted to know how you were situated,&rdquo; said the other&mdash;&ldquo;how
      badly you wanted to sell the stock. So when he came to do business with
      you, he'd have you where he wanted you, and he'd probably get fifty per
      cent off the price because of it. You'll be lucky if he doesn't have a few
      loans called on you at your bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major sat watching Montague, smiling at his naivete. &ldquo;Where did you
      say this road was?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;In Mississippi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering about it,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It is not likely that it's
      Jim Hegan at all. I don't believe anybody could get him to take an
      interest in Southern railroads. He has probably mentioned it to someone
      else. What's your road good for, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had a plan to extend it,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would take but one or two millions to carry it to the main works of
      the Mississippi Steel Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major gave a start. &ldquo;The Mississippi Steel Company!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the world did you take a matter like that to Jim Hegan?&rdquo; demanded
      Major Venable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it to him because I knew him,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one doesn't take things to people because one knows them,&rdquo; said the
      Major. &ldquo;One takes them to the right people. If Jim Hegan could have his
      way, he would wipe the Mississippi Steel Company off the map of the United
      States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;that Mississippi Steel is the chief
      competitor of the Trust? And old Dan Waterman organised the Steel Trust,
      and watches it all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's that got to do with Hegan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply that Jim Hegan works with Waterman in everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague stared in dismay. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;My dear fellow, why don't you come to me
      before you do things like that? You should have gone to the Mississippi
      Steel people; and you should have gone quietly, and to the men at the top.
      For all you can tell, you may have a really big proposition that's been
      overlooked in the shuffle. What was that you said about the survey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Montague told in detail the story of the aborted plan for an
      extension, and of his hunting trip, and what he had learned on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;you are in the heart of the thing right now.
      The Steel people balked your plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They bought up the survey. And they've probably controlled your railroad
      ever since, and kept it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's impossible! They've had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;How could you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the president,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;He's an old friend of the
      family's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But suppose they have a mortgage on his business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not buy the road and be done with it?&rdquo; added Montague, in
      perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed. &ldquo;I am reminded of a famous saying of Wyman's,&mdash;'Why
      should I buy stock when I can buy directors?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's those same people who are watching you now,&rdquo; he continued, after a
      pause. &ldquo;Probably they think it is some move of the other side, and they
      are trying to run the thing down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who owns the Mississippi Steel Company?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I fancy that Wyman must have come into it
      somehow. Didn't you notice in the papers the other day that the contracts
      for furnishing rails for all his three transcontinental railroads had gone
      to the Mississippi Steel Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; said the Major, with a chuckle. &ldquo;You have jumped right into the
      middle of the frog pond, and the Lord only knows what a ruction you have
      stirred up! Just think of the situation for a moment. The Steel Trust is
      over-capitalised two hundred per cent. Because of the tariff it is able to
      sell its product at home for fifty per cent more than it charges abroad;
      and even so, it has to keep cutting its dividends! Its common stock is
      down to ten. It is cutting expenses on every hand, and of course it's
      turning out a rotten product. And now along comes Wyman, the one man in
      Wall Street who dares to shake his fist at old Dan Waterman; and he gives
      the newspapers all the facts about the bad steel rails that are causing
      smash-ups on his roads; and he turns all his contracts over to the
      Mississippi Steel Company, which is under-selling the Trust. The company
      is swamped with orders, and its plants are running day and night. And then
      along comes a guileless young fool with a little dinky railroad which he
      wants to run into the Company's back door-yard; and he takes the
      proposition to Jim Hegan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major arrived at his climax in a state of suppressed emotion, which
      culminated in a chuckle, which shook his rubicund visage and brought a
      series of twitches to his aching toe. As for Montague, he was duly
      humbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do now?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see that there's anything to do,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;except to hold
      on tight to your stock. Perhaps if you go on talking out loud about your
      extension, some of the Steel people will buy you out at your own price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave them a scare, anyhow,&rdquo; said Montague, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can wager one thing,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;There has been a fine shaking up
      in somebody's office down town! There's a man who comes here every night,
      who's probably heard of it. That's Will Roberts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Major looked about the dining-room. &ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the farther end of the room there had entered a tall, dark-haired man,
      with a keen expression and a brisk step. &ldquo;Roberts the Silent,&rdquo; said the
      Major. &ldquo;Let's have a try at him.&rdquo; And as the man passed near, he hailed
      him. &ldquo;Hello! Roberts, where are you going? Let me introduce my friend, Mr.
      Allan Montague.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at Montague. &ldquo;Good evening, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How are you,
      Venable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't be worse, thank you,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;How are things with you
      on the Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dull, very dull,&rdquo; said Roberts, as he passed on. &ldquo;Matters look bad, I'm
      afraid. Too many people making money rapidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major chuckled. &ldquo;A fine sentiment,&rdquo; he said, when Roberts had passed
      out of hearing&mdash;&ldquo;from a man who has made sixty millions in the last
      ten years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did not appear that he had ever heard of me,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, trust him for that!&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;He might have been planning to
      have your throat cut to-night, but you wouldn't have seen him turn an
      eyelid. He is that sort; he's made of steel himself, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and then went on, in a reminiscent mood, &ldquo;You've read of the
      great strike, I suppose? It was Roberts put that job through. He made
      himself the worst-hated man in the country&mdash;Gad! how the newspapers
      and the politicians used to rage at him! But he stood his ground&mdash;he
      would win that strike or die in the attempt. And he very nearly did both,
      you know. An Anarchist came to his office and shot him twice; but he got
      the fellow down and nearly choked the life out of him, and he ran the
      strike on his sick-bed, and two weeks later he was back in his office
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the Major's store-rooms of gossip were unlocked. He told Montague
      about the kings of Steel, and about the men they had hated and the women
      they had loved, and about the inmost affairs and secrets of their lives.
      William H. Roberts had begun his career in the service of the great
      iron-master, whose deadly rival he had afterwards become; and now he lived
      but to dispute that rival's claims to glory. Let the rival build a
      library, Roberts would build two. Let the rival put up a great office
      building, Roberts would buy all the land about it, and put up half a
      dozen, and completely shut out its light. And day and night &ldquo;Roberts the
      Silent&rdquo; was plotting and planning, and some day he would be the master of
      the Steel Trust, and his rival would be nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are lively chaps, the Steel crowd,&rdquo; said the Major, chuckling. &ldquo;You
      will have to keep your eyes open when you do business with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you advise me to do?&rdquo; asked the other, smiling. &ldquo;Set
      detectives after them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the Major, seriously. &ldquo;Why not find out who sent that
      Colonel Cole to see you? And find out how badly he needs your little
      railroad, and make him pay for it accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not QUITE in my line,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's time you were learning,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;I can start you. I know a
      detective whom you can trust.&mdash;At any rate,&rdquo; he added cautiously, &ldquo;I
      don't know that he's ever played me false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague sat for a while in thought. &ldquo;You said something about their
      getting after one's telephone,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Did you really mean that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that they could find out what goes over my
      'phone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to tell you,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;that for two hundred and fifty
      dollars, I can get you a stenographic report of every word that you say
      over your 'phone for twenty-four hours, and of every word that anybody
      says to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds incredible!&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Who does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wire tappers. It's dangerous work, but the pay is big. I have a friend
      who once upon a time was putting through a deal in which the telephone
      company was interested, and they transferred his wire to another branch,
      and he finished up his business before the other side got on to the trick.
      To this day you'll notice that his telephone is 'Spring,' though every
      other 'phone in the neighbourhood is 'John.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mail, too?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mail!&rdquo; echoed the Major. &ldquo;What's easier than that? You can hold up a
      man's mail for twenty-four hours and take a photograph of every letter.
      You can do the same with every letter that he mails, unless he is very
      careful. He can be followed, you understand, and every time he drops a
      letter, a blue or yellow envelope is dropped on top&mdash;for a signal to
      the post-office people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, so many persons would have to know about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind. That's a regular branch of the post-office work.
      There are Secret Service men who are watching criminals that way all the
      time. And what could be easier than to pay one of them, and to have your
      enemy listed with the suspects?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major smiled in amusement. It always gave him delight to witness
      Montague's consternation over his pictures of the city's corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are things even stranger than that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can introduce you
      to a man who's in this room now, who was fighting the Ship-building
      swindle, and he got hold of a lot of important papers, and he took them to
      his office, and sat by while his clerks made thirty-two copies of them.
      And he put the originals and thirty-one of the copies in thirty-two
      different safe-deposit vaults in the city, and took the other copy to his
      home in a valise. And that night burglars broke in, and the valise was
      missing. The next day he wrote to the people he was fighting, 'I was going
      to send you a copy of the papers which have come into my possession, but
      as you already have a copy, I will simply proceed to outline my
      proposition.' And that was all. They settled for a million or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major paused a moment and looked across the dining-room. &ldquo;There goes
      Dick Sanderson,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a dapper young man with a handsome,
      smooth-shaven face. &ldquo;He represents the New Jersey Southern Railroad. And
      one day another lawyer who met him at dinner remarked, 'I am going to
      bring a stockholders' suit against your road to-morrow.' He went on to
      outline the case, which was a big one. Sanderson said nothing, but he went
      out and telephoned to their agent in Trenton, and the next morning a bill
      went through both houses of the Legislature providing a statute of
      limitations that outlawed the case. The man who was the victim of that
      trick is now the Governor of New York State, and if you ever meet him, you
      can ask him about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause for a while; then suddenly the Major remarked, &ldquo;Oh, by
      the way, this beautiful widow you have brought up from Mississippi&mdash;Mrs.
      Taylor&mdash;is that the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that Stanley Ryder has taken quite a fancy to her,&rdquo; said the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grave look came upon Montague's face. &ldquo;I am sorry, indeed, that you have
      heard it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;that's all right. He will give her a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy is new to New York,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I don't think she quite
      realises the sort of man that Ryder is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major thought for a moment, then suddenly began to laugh. &ldquo;It might be
      just as well for her to be careful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I happened to think of it&mdash;they
      say that Mrs. Stanley is getting ready to free herself from the
      matrimonial bond; and if your fascinating widow doesn't want to get into
      the newspapers, she had better be a little careful with her favours.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two or three days after this Montague met Jim Hegan at a directors'
      meeting. He watched him closely, but Hegan gave no sign of constraint. He
      was courteous and serene as ever. &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      mentioned that railroad matter to a friend who is interested. You may hear
      from him in a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to you,&rdquo; said the other, and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Sunday, and Montague came to take Lucy to church, and
      told her of this remark. He did not tell her about the episode with
      Colonel Cole, for he thought there was no use disturbing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, for her part, had other matters to talk about. &ldquo;By the way, Allan,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;I presume you know that the coaching parade is to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ryder has offered me a seat on his coach,&rdquo; said Lucy.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suppose you are going to be angry with me,&rdquo; she added quickly, seeing his
      frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you would go?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I did not think it would be any harm. It is such a
      public matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A public matter!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague. &ldquo;I should think so! To sit up on
      top of a coach for the crowds to stare at, and for thirty or forty
      newspaper reporters to take snap-shots of! And to have yourself blazoned
      as the fascinating young widow from Mississippi who was one of Stanley
      Ryder's party, and then to have all Society looking at the picture and
      winking and making remarks about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take such a cynical view of everything,&rdquo; protested Lucy. &ldquo;How can
      people help it if the crowds will stare, and if the newspapers will take
      pictures? Surely one cannot give up the pleasure of going for a drive&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw, Lucy!&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;You have too much sense to talk like
      that. If you want to drive, go ahead and drive. But when a lot of people
      get together and pay ten or twenty thousand dollars apiece for fancy
      coaches and horses, and then appoint a day and send out notice to the
      whole city, and dress themselves up in fancy costumes and go out and make
      a public parade of themselves, they have no right to talk about driving
      for pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, dubiously, &ldquo;it's nice to be noticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for those who like it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and if a woman chooses to set out
      on a publicity campaign, and run a press bureau, and make herself a public
      character, why, that's her privilege. But for heaven's sake let her drop
      the sickly pretence that she is only driving beautiful horses, or
      listening to music, or entertaining her friends. I suppose a Society woman
      has as much right to advertise her personality as a politician or a
      manufacturer of pills; all I object to is the sham of it, the everlasting
      twaddle about her love of privacy. Take Mrs. Winnie Duval, for instance.
      You would think to hear her that her one ideal in life was to be a simple
      shepherdess and to raise flowers; but, as a matter of fact, she keeps a
      scrap-album, and if a week passes that the newspapers do not have some
      paragraphs about her doings, she begins to get restless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy broke into a laugh. &ldquo;I was at Mrs. Robbie Walling's last night,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;She was talking about the crowds at the opera, and she said she was
      going to withdraw to some place where she wouldn't have to see such mobs
      of ugly people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you can't tell me anything about Mrs. Robbie Walling.
      I have been there. There's nothing that lady does from the time she opens
      her eyes in the morning until the time she goes to bed the next morning
      that she would ever care to do if it were not for the mobs of ugly people
      looking on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;You seem to be going everywhere,&rdquo; said Montague, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess I'm a success,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I am certainly having a gorgeous
      time. I never saw so many beautiful houses or such dazzling costumes in my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very fine,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;But take it slowly and make it last.
      When one has got used to it, the life seems rather dull and grey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am invited to the Wymans' to-night,&rdquo; said Lucy,&mdash;&ldquo;to play bridge.
      Fancy giving a bridge party on Sunday night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;<i>Cosí fan tutti</i>,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of Betty Wyman?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is having a good time,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don't think she has much
      conscience about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she very much in love with Ollie?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can't make them out. It doesn't seem to
      trouble them very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was after church while they were strolling down the Avenue, gazing at
      the procession of new spring costumes.&mdash;&ldquo;Who is that stately creature
      you just bowed to?&rdquo; inquired Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That?&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;That is Miss Hegan&mdash;Jim Hegan's daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I remember&mdash;Betty Wyman told me about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing very good, I imagine,&rdquo; said Montague, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was interesting,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Fancy having a father with a hundred
      millions, and talking about going in for settlement work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I told you one could get tired of the splurge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy looked at him quizzically. &ldquo;I should think that kind of a girl would
      rather appeal to you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to know her very much,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but she didn't seem to
      like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like you!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;Why, how perfectly outrageous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not her fault,&rdquo; said Montague, smiling; &ldquo;I am afraid I got myself
      a bad reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean about Mrs. Winnie!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that's it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me about it,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing much to tell. Mrs. Winnie proceeded to take me up and
      make a social success of me, and I was fool enough to come when she
      invited me. Then the first thing I knew, all the gossips were wagging
      their tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That didn't do you any harm, did it?&rdquo; asked Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; said he, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;Only here is a
      woman whom I would have liked to know, and I don't know her. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy gave him a sly glance. &ldquo;You need a sister,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
      &ldquo;Somebody to fight for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      According to Jim Hegan's prediction, it was not long before Montague
      received an offer. It came from a firm of lawyers of whom he had never
      heard. &ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; ran the letter, &ldquo;that you have a block of five
      thousand shares of the stock of the Northern Mississippi Railroad. We have
      a client on whose behalf we are authorised to offer you fifty thousand
      dollars cash for these shares. Will you kindly consult with your client,
      and advise us at your earliest convenience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called up Lucy on the 'phone and told her that the offer had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not satisfactory,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I would rather not discuss the
      matter over the 'phone. How can I arrange to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you send me up the letter by a messenger?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;but I would like to talk with you about it; and
      also I have that mortgage, and the other papers for you to sign. There are
      some things to be explained about these, also. Couldn't you come to my
      office this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, Allan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I have just made a most important
      engagement, and I don't know what to do about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't it be postponed?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's an invitation to join a party on Mr. Waterman's new
      yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Brünnhilde</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague. &ldquo;You don't say so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I hate to miss it,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long shall you be gone?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back sometime this evening,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We are going up
      the Sound. The yacht has just been put into commission, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she lying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off the Battery. I am to be on board in an hour, and I was just about to
      start. Couldn't you possibly meet me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I will come over. I suppose they will wait a few
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am half dying to know about the offer,&rdquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had a couple of callers, which delayed him somewhat; finally he
      jumped into a cab and drove to the Battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in the neighbourhood of Castle Garden, was a sheltered place
      popularly known as the &ldquo;Millionaires' Basin,&rdquo; being the favourite
      anchorage of the private yachts of the &ldquo;Wall Street flotilla.&rdquo; At this
      time of the year most of the great men had already moved out to their
      country places, and those of them who lived on the Hudson or up the Sound
      would come to their offices in vessels of every size, from racing
      motor-boats to huge private steamships. They would have their breakfasts
      served on board, and would have their secretaries and their mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these yachts were floating palaces of incredible magnificence;
      one, upon which Montague had been a guest, had a glass-domed library
      extending entirely around its upper deck. This one was the property of the
      Lester Todds, and the main purpose it served was to carry them upon their
      various hunting trips; its equipment included such luxuries as a French
      laundry, a model dairy and poultry-yard, an ice-machine and a
      shooting-gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here lay the <i>Brünnhilde</i>, the wonderful new toy of old Waterman.
      Montague knew all about her, for she had just been completed that spring,
      and not a newspaper in the Metropolis but had had her picture, and full
      particulars about her cost. Waterman had purchased her from the King of
      Belgium, who had thought she was everything the soul of a monarch could
      desire. Great had been his consternation when he learned that the new
      owner had given orders to strip her down to the bare steel hull and refit
      and refurnish her. The saloon was now done with Louis Quinze decorations,
      said the newspapers. Its walls were panelled in satinwood and inlaid
      walnut, and under foot were velvet carpets twelve feet wide and woven
      without seam. Its closets were automatically lighted, and opened at the
      touch of a button; even the drawers of its bureaus were upon
      ball-bearings. The owner's private bedroom measured the entire width of
      the vessel, twenty-eight feet, and opened upon a Roman bath of white
      marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the <i>Brünnhilde</i>, Montague looked about him for one of the
      yacht's launches, but he could not find any, so he hailed a boatman and
      had himself rowed out. A man in uniform met him at the steps. &ldquo;Is Mrs.
      Taylor on board?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is,&rdquo; the other answered. &ldquo;Is this Mr. Montague? She left word for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague had begun to ascend; but a half a second later he stopped short
      in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through one of the portholes of the vessel he heard distinctly a muffled
      cry,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he recognised the voice. It was Lucy's!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0005" id="link2HCH0005"> </a>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montague hesitated only an instant. He sprang up to the deck. &ldquo;Where is
      Mrs. Taylor?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went below, sir,&rdquo; said the man, hesitating; but Montague sprang past
      him and down the companionway.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the stairs he found himself in a broad entrance-hall,
      lighted by a glass dome above. He sprang toward a door which opened in the
      direction of the cry he had heard, and shouted aloud, &ldquo;Lucy! Lucy!&rdquo; He
      heard her answer beyond the doorway, and he seized the knob and tried it.
      The door was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sound. &ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; he called again, &ldquo;or I'll break it
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suiting his action to the word, he flung his weight upon it. The barrier
      cracked; and then suddenly he heard a man's voice. &ldquo;All right. Wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Someone fumbled at the knob; and Montague stood crouching and watching
      breathlessly, prepared for anything. The door opened, and he found himself
      confronted by Dan Waterman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague recoiled a step in consternation; and the other strode out, and
      without a word went past him down the hall. There was just time enough for
      Montague to receive one look&mdash;of the most furious rage that he had
      ever seen upon a human face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed into the room. Lucy was standing at the farther end, leaning
      upon a table to support herself. Her clothing was in disarray, and her
      hair was falling about her ears; her face was flushed, and she was panting
      in great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo; he gasped, running to her. She caught at his arm to steady
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he cried. She turned her face away, making not a
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or so he stood staring at her. Then she whispered, &ldquo;Quick!
      let us go from here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a sudden movement of her hands, she swept her hair back from her
      forehead, and straightened her clothing, and started to the door, leaning
      upon her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up to the deck, where the officer was still standing in
      perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor wishes to go ashore,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Will you get us a
      boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The launch will be back in a few minutes, sir&mdash;&rdquo; the man began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wish to go at once,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Will you let us have one of those
      rowboats? Otherwise I shall hail that tug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated but a moment. Montague's voice was determined, and so he
      turned and gave orders to lower a small boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Lucy stood, breathing heavily, and gazing about her
      nervously. When at last they had left the yacht, he heard her sigh with
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence until she had stepped upon the landing. Then she said,
      &ldquo;Get me a cab, Allan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led her to the street and hailed a vehicle. When they were seated, Lucy
      sank back with a gasp. &ldquo;Please don't ask me to talk, Allan,&rdquo; she said. And
      she made not another sound during the long drive to the hotel.
    </p>
    <h3>
      * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo; he said, after he had seen her
      safely to her apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am all right. Wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She retired to her dressing-room, and when she came back, all traces of
      her excitement had been removed. Then she seated herself in a chair
      opposite Montague and gazed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I have been trying to think. What can I do to that
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don't know,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can hardly believe that this is New York,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I feel as
      though I had got back into the Middle Ages!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Lucy,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that I don't know what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she fell silent. They sat staring at each other, and then suddenly
      she leaned back in her chair and began to laugh. Once she had started,
      burst after burst of merriment swept over her. &ldquo;I try to stay angry,
      Allan!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;It seems as if I ought to. But, honestly, it was
      perfectly absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you'd much better laugh than cry,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you about it, Allan,&rdquo; the girl went on. &ldquo;I know I shall have
      to tell somebody, or I shall simply explode. You will have to advise me
      about it, for I was never more bewildered in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Begin at the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you how I met Waterman at his art gallery,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Mr. David
      Alden took me, and the old man was so polite, and so dignified&mdash;why,
      I never had the slightest idea! And then he wrote me a little note&mdash;in
      his own hand, mind you&mdash;inviting me to be one of a party for the
      first trip of the <i>Brünnhilde</i>. Of course, I thought it was all
      right. I told you I was going, you know, and you didn't have any
      objections either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went down there, and the launch met me and took me on board, and a
      steward took me down into that room and left me, and a second later the
      old man himself came in. And he shut the door behind him and locked it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Taylor?' he said, and before I had a chance even to
      open my mouth and reply, he came to me and calmly put his arms around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can fancy my feelings. I was simply paralysed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Waterman?' I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't hear what he said; I was almost dazed with anger and fright. I
      remember I cried several times, 'Let me go!' but he paid not the slightest
      attention to me. He just held me tight in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally I got myself together, a little. I didn't want to bite and
      scratch like a kitchen-wench. I tried to speak calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mr. Waterman,' I said, 'I want you to release me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I love you,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But I don't love you,' I protested. I remember thinking even then how
      absurd it sounded. I can't think of anything that wouldn't have sounded
      absurd in such a situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You will learn to love me,' he said. 'Many women have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I am not that sort of a woman,' I said. 'I tell you, you have made a
      mistake. Let me go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I want you,' he said. 'And when I want a thing, I get it. I never take
      any refusal&mdash;understand that. You don't realise the situation. It
      will be no disgrace to you. Women think it an honour to have me love them.
      Think what I can do for you. You can have anything you want. You can go
      anywhere you wish. I will never stint you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember his going on like that for some time. And fancy, there I was!
      I might as well have been in the grip of a bear. You would not think it,
      you know, but he is terribly strong. I could not move. I could hardly
      think. I was suffocated, and all the time I could feel his breath on my
      face, and he was glaring into my eyes like some terrible wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mr. Waterman,' I protested, 'I am not used to being treated in this
      way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I know, I know,' he said. 'If you were, I should not want you. But I am
      different from other men. Think of it&mdash;think of all that I have on my
      hands. I have no time to make love to women. But I love you. I loved you
      the minute I saw you. Is not that enough? What more can you ask?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You have brought me here under false pretences,' I cried. 'You have
      taken cowardly advantage of me. If you have a spark of decency in you, you
      should be ashamed of yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tut, tut,' he said, 'don't talk that kind of nonsense. You know the
      world. You are no spring chicken.'&mdash;Yes, he did, Allan&mdash;I
      remember that very phrase. And it made me so furious&mdash;you can't
      imagine! I tried to get away again, but the more I struggled, the more it
      seemed to enrage him. I was positively terrified. You know, I don't
      believe there was another person on board that yacht except his servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mr. Waterman,' I cried, 'I tell you to take your hands off me. If you
      don't, I will make a disturbance. I will scream.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It won't do you any good,' he said savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But what do you want me to do?&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I want you to love me,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I began to struggle again. I shouted once or twice,&mdash;I am
      not sure,&mdash;and then he clapped his hand over my mouth. Then I began
      to fight for my life. I really believe I would have scratched the old
      creature's eyes out if he had not heard you out in the hall. When you
      called my name, he dropped me and sprang back. I never saw such furious
      hatred on a man's countenance in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I answered you, I tried to run to the door, but he stood in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I will follow you!' he whispered. 'Do you understand me? I will never
      give you up!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you flung yourself against the door, and he turned and opened it
      and went out.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Lucy had turned scarlet over the recalling of the scene, and she was
      breathing quickly in her agitation. Montague sat staring in front of him,
      without a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of anything like that in your life before?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, gravely, &ldquo;I am sorry to say that I have heard of it
      several times. I have heard of things even worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Surely a man can't behave like that
      with impunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a monster!&rdquo; cried Lucy. &ldquo;I ought to have him put in jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague shook his head. &ldquo;You couldn't do that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't prove it,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be your word against his, and they would take his every time.
      You can't go and have Dan Waterman arrested as you could any ordinary man.
      And think of the notoriety it would mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to expose him,&rdquo; protested Lucy. &ldquo;It would serve him right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not do him the least harm in the world,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I can
      speak quite positively there, for I have seen it tried. You couldn't get a
      newspaper in New York to publish that story. All that you could do would
      be to have yourself blazoned as an adventuress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was staring, with clenched hands. &ldquo;Why, I might as well be living in
      Turkey,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nearly,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There's an old man in this town who has spent his
      lifetime lending money and hoarding it; he has something like eighty or a
      hundred millions now, I believe, and once every six months or so you will
      read in the newspapers that some woman has made an attempt to blackmail
      him. That is because he does to every pretty girl who comes into his
      office just exactly what old Waterman did to you; and those who are
      arrested for blackmail are simply the ones who are so unwise as to make a
      disturbance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Lucy,&rdquo; continued Montague, after a pause, &ldquo;you must realise the
      situation. This man is a god in New York. He controls all the avenues of
      wealth; he can make or break any person he chooses. It is really the truth&mdash;I
      believe he could ruin any man in the city whom he chose to set out after.
      He can have anything that he wants done, so far as the police are
      concerned. It is simply a matter of paying them. And he is accustomed to
      rule in everything; his lightest whim is law. If he wants a thing, he buys
      it, and that is his attitude toward women. He is used to being treated as
      a master; women seek him, and vie for his favour. If you had been able to
      hold it, you might have had a million-dollar palace on Riverside Drive, or
      a cottage with a million-dollar pier at Newport. You might have had carte
      blanche at all the shops, and all the yachting trips and private trains
      that you wanted. That is all that other women want, and he could not
      understand what more you could want.&rdquo; Montague paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the way he spends his money?&rdquo; Lucy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He buys everything he takes a fancy to,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;They say he
      spends five thousand dollars a day. One of the stories they tell in the
      clubs is that he loved the wife of a physician, and he gave a million
      dollars to found a hospital, and one of the conditions of the endowment
      was that this physician should go abroad for three years and study all the
      hospitals of Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy sat buried in thought. &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she asked suddenly, &ldquo;what do you
      suppose he meant by saying he would follow me? What could he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;it is something which we shall have to think
      over very carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made a remark to me that I thought was very strange,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      just happened to recall it. He said, 'You have no money. You cannot keep
      up the pace in New York. What you own is worth nothing.' Do you suppose,
      Allan, that he can know anything about my affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was staring at her in consternation. &ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said; and he added to himself, &ldquo;No, it is absurd. It could
      not be.&rdquo; The idea that it could have been Dan Waterman who had set the
      detectives to follow him seemed too grotesque for consideration. &ldquo;It was
      nothing but a chance shot,&rdquo; he said to Lucy, &ldquo;but you must be careful. He
      is a dangerous man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am powerless to punish him!&rdquo; whispered Lucy, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;that you are very well out of it. You
      will know better next time; and as for punishing him, I fancy that Nature
      will attend to that. He is getting old, you know; and they say he is
      morose and wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Allan!&rdquo; protested Lucy. &ldquo;I can't help thinking what would have
      happened to me if you had not come on board! I can't help thinking about
      other women who must have been caught in such a trap. Why, Allan, I would
      have been equally helpless&mdash;no matter what he had done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; said he, gravely. &ldquo;Many a woman has discovered it, I
      imagine. I understand how you feel, but what can you do about it? You
      can't punish men like Waterman. You can't punish them for anything they
      do, whether it is monopolising a necessity of life and starving thousands
      of people to death, or whether it is an attack upon a defenceless woman.
      There are rich men in this city who make it their diversion to answer
      advertisements and decoy young girls. A stenographer in my office told me
      that she had had over twenty positions in one year, and that she had left
      every one because some man in the office had approached her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I have been finding out
      these things. You thought I was unreasonable, but I know what your dangers
      are. You are a stranger here; you have no friends and no influence, and so
      you will always be the one to suffer. I don't mean merely in a case like
      this, where it comes to the police and the newspapers; I mean in social
      matters&mdash;where it is a question of your reputation, of the
      interpretation which people will place upon your actions. They have their
      wealth and their prestige and their privileges, and they stand at bay.
      They are perfectly willing to give a stranger a good time, if the stranger
      has a pretty face and a lively wit to entertain them; but when you come to
      trespass, or to threaten their power, then you find out how they can hate
      you, and how mercilessly they will slander and ruin you!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lucy's adventure had so taken up the attention of them both that they had
      forgotten all about the matter of the stock. Afterwards, however, Montague
      mentioned it, and Lucy exclaimed indignantly at the smallness of the
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is only ten cents on the dollar!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You surely would not
      advise me to sell for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I should reject the offer. It might be
      well, however, to set a price for them to consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had talked this matter over before, and had agreed upon a hundred and
      eighty thousand dollars. &ldquo;I think it will be best to state that figure,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;and give them to understand that it is final. I imagine they
      would expect to bargain, but I am not much of a hand at that, and would
      prefer to say what I mean and stick by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;you use your own judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; then Montague, seeing the look on Lucy's face, started
      to his feet. &ldquo;It won't do you any good to think about to-day's mishap,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Let's start over again, and not make any more mistakes. Come with
      me this evening. I have some friends who have been begging me to bring you
      around ever since you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Prentice and his wife. Do you know of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard Mr. Ryder speak of Prentice the banker. Is that the one you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Montague,&mdash;&ldquo;the president of the Trust Company of the
      Republic. He was an old comrade of my father's, and they were the first
      people I met here in New York. I have got to know them very well since. I
      told them I would bring you up to dinner sometime, and I will telephone
      them, if you say so. I don't think it's a good idea for you to sit here by
      yourself and think about Dan Waterman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mind it now,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;But I will go with you, if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      They went to the Prentices'. There were the General himself, and Mrs.
      Prentice, and their two daughters, one of whom was a student in college,
      and the other a violinist of considerable talent. General Prentice was now
      over seventy, and his beard was snow-white, but he still had the erect
      carriage and the commanding presence of a soldier. Mrs. Prentice Montague
      had first met one evening when he had been their guest at the opera, and
      she had impressed him as a lady with a great many diamonds, who talked to
      him about other people while he was trying to listen to the music. But she
      was, as Lucy phrased it afterwards, &ldquo;a motherly soul, when one got
      underneath her war-paint.&rdquo; She was always inviting Montague to her home
      and introducing him to people whom she thought would be of assistance to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also there came that evening young Harry Curtiss, the General's nephew.
      Montague had never met him before, but he knew him as a junior partner in
      the firm of William E. Davenant, the famous corporation lawyer&mdash;the
      man whom Montague had found opposed to him in his suit against the
      Fidelity Insurance Company. Harry Curtiss, whom Montague was to know quite
      well before long, was a handsome fellow, with frank and winning manners.
      He had met Alice Montague at an affair a week or so ago, and he sent word
      that he was coming to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they sat and smoked, and talked about the condition of the
      market. It was a time of great agitation in Wall Street. There had been a
      violent slump in stocks, and matters seemed to be going from bad to worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that Wyman has got caught,&rdquo; said Curtiss, repeating one of the
      wild tales of the &ldquo;Street.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was talking with one of his brokers
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wyman is not an easy man to catch,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;His own brokers
      are often the last men to know his real situation. There is good reason to
      believe that some of the big insiders are loaded up, for the public is
      very uneasy, as you know; but with the situation as it is just now in Wall
      Street, you can't tell anything. The men who are really on the inside have
      matters so completely in their own hands that they are practically
      omnipotent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you think this slump may be the result of manipulation?&rdquo;
       asked Montague, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be such a widespread movement,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;It seems
      incredible that any one man could cause such an upset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not one man,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;it is a group of men. I don't say
      that it's true, mind you. I wouldn't be at liberty to say it even if I
      knew it; but there are certain things that I have seen, and I have my
      suspicions of others. And you must realise that a half-dozen men now
      control about ninety per cent of the banks of this city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things will get worse before they get any better, I believe,&rdquo; said
      Curtiss, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has got to be done,&rdquo; replied the General. &ldquo;The banking
      situation in this country at the present moment is simply unendurable; the
      legitimate banker is practically driven from the field by the speculator.
      A man finds himself in the position where he has either to submit to the
      dictation of such men, or else permit himself to be supplanted. It is a
      new element that has forced itself in. Apparently all a man needs in order
      to start a bank is credit enough to put up a building with marble columns
      and bronze gates. I could name you a man who at this moment owns eight
      banks, and when he started in, three years ago, I don't believe he owned a
      million dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how in the world could he manage it?&rdquo; gasped Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I stated,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;You buy a piece of land, with as
      big a mortgage as you can get, and you put up a million-dollar building
      and mortgage that. You start a trust company, and you get out imposing
      advertisements, and promise high rates of interest, and the public comes
      in. Then you hypothecate your stock in company number one, and you have
      your dummy directors lend you more money, and you buy another trust
      company. They call that pyramiding&mdash;you have heard the term, no
      doubt, with regard to stocks; it is a fascinating game to play with banks,
      because the more of them you get, the more prominent you become in the
      newspapers, and the more the public trusts you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the General went on to tell of some of the cases of which he knew.
      There was Stewart, the young Lochinvar out of the West. He had tried to
      buy the Trust Company of the Republic long ago, and so the General knew
      him and his methods. He had fought the Copper Trust to a standstill in
      Montana; the Trust had bought up the Legislature and both political
      machines, but Cummings had appealed to the public in a series of
      sensational campaigns, and had got his judges into office, and in the end
      the Trust had been forced to buy him out. And now he had come to New York
      to play this new game of bank-gambling, which paid even quicker profits
      than buying courts.&mdash;And then there was Holt, a sporting character, a
      vulgar man-about-town, who was identified with everything that was low and
      vile in the city; he, too, had turned his millions into banks.&mdash;And
      there was Cummings, the Ice King, who for years had financed the political
      machine in the city, and, by securing a monopoly of the
      docking-privileges, had forced all his rivals to the wall. He had set out
      to monopolise the coastwise steamship trade of the country, and had bought
      line after line of vessels by this same device of &ldquo;pyramiding&rdquo;; and now,
      finding that he needed still more money to buy out his rivals, he had
      purchased or started a dozen or so of trust companies and banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyone ought to realise that such things cannot go on indefinitely,&rdquo; said
      the General. &ldquo;I know that the big men realise it. I was at a directors'
      meeting the other day, and I heard Waterman remark that it would have to
      be ended very soon. Anyone who knows Waterman would not expect to get a
      second hint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could he do?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waterman!&rdquo; exclaimed young Curtiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would find a way,&rdquo; said the General, simply. &ldquo;That is the one hope
      that I see in the situation&mdash;the power of a conservative man like
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You trust him, then?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;I trust him.&mdash;One has to trust somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a curious story,&rdquo; put in Harry Curtiss. &ldquo;My uncle had dinner at
      the old man's house the other night, and asked him what he thought of the
      market. 'I can tell you in a sentence,' was the answer. 'For the first
      time in my life I don't own a security.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General gave an exclamation of surprise. &ldquo;Did he really say that?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;Then one can imagine that things will happen before long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one can imagine why the stock market is weak!&rdquo; added the other,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door of the dining-room was opened, and Mrs. Prentice
      appeared. &ldquo;Are you men going to talk business all evening?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If
      so, come into the drawing-room, and talk it to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They arose and followed her, and Montague seated himself upon a sofa with
      Mrs. Prentice and the younger man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you saying of Dan Waterman?&rdquo; she asked of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's a long story,&rdquo; said Curtiss. &ldquo;You ladies don't care anything
      about Waterman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague had been watching Lucy out of the corner of his eye, and he could
      not forbear a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful man he is!&rdquo; said Mrs. Prentice. &ldquo;I admire him more than
      any man I know of in Wall Street.&rdquo; Then she turned to Montague. &ldquo;Have you
      met him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he; and added with a mischievous smile, &ldquo;I saw him to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him last Sunday night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Prentice, guilelessly. &ldquo;It was at
      the Church of the Holy Virgin, where he passes the collection-plate. Isn't
      it admirable that a man who has as much on his mind as Mr. Waterman has,
      should still save time for the affairs of his church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Montague looked again at Lucy, and saw that she was biting her lip.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a week before Montague saw Lucy again. She came in to lunch with
      Alice one day, when he happened to be home early.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to dinner at Mrs. Frank Landis's last night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And who
      do you think was there&mdash;your friend, Mrs. Winnie Duval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had quite a long talk with her,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I liked her very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is easy to like,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;What did you talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everything in the world but one thing,&rdquo; said Lucy, mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, you goose,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Mrs. Winnie knew that I was your friend,
      and I had a feeling that every word she was saying was a message to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what did she have to say to me?&rdquo; he asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants you to understand that she is cheerful, and not pining away
      because of you,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;She told me about all the things that
      she was interested in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she tell you about the Babubanana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what?&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when I saw her last,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;she was turning into a Hindoo,
      and her talk was all about Swamis, and Gnanis, and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she didn't mention them,&rdquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, probably she has given it up, then,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has gone in for anti-vivisection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anti-vivisection!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;didn't you see in the papers that she had been
      elected an honorary vice-president of some society or other, and had
      contributed several thousand dollars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One cannot keep track of Mrs. Winnie in the newspapers,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;she has heard some dreadful stories about how
      surgeons maltreat poor cats and dogs, and she would insist on telling me
      all about it. It was the most shocking dinner-table conversation
      imaginable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She certainly is a magnificent-looking creature,&rdquo; said Lucy, after a
      pause. &ldquo;I don't wonder the men fall in love with her. She had her hair
      done up with some kind of a band across the front, and I declare she might
      have been an Egyptian princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has many roles,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really true,&rdquo; asked the other, &ldquo;that she paid fifty thousand
      dollars for a bath-tub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she did,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The newspapers say it, too, so I suppose
      it is true. I know Duval told me with his own lips that she cost him a
      million dollars a year; but then that may have been because he was angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he so rich as all that?&rdquo; asked Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how rich he is personally,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I know he is one
      of the most powerful men in New York. They call him the 'System's'
      banker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard Mr. Ryder speak of him,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very favourably, I imagine,&rdquo; said he, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;they had some kind of a quarrel. What was the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about it,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;But Ryder is a free
      lance, and a new man, and Duval works with the big men who don't like to
      have trespassers about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was silent for a minute; her brows were knit in thought. &ldquo;Is it
      really true that Mr. Ryder's position is so unstable? I thought the Gotham
      Trust Company was one of the largest institutions in the country. What are
      those huge figures that you see in their advertisements,&mdash;seventy
      millions&mdash;eighty millions&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is not that true?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess that's true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't know anything about Ryder's
      affairs, you know&mdash;I simply hear the gossip. Everyone says he is
      playing a bold game. You take my advice, and keep your money somewhere
      else. You have to be doubly careful because you have enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enemies?&rdquo; asked Lucy, in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten what Waterman said to you?&rdquo; Montague asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to tell me,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;that you think that Waterman
      would interfere with Mr. Ryder on my account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds incredible, I know,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;but such things have
      happened before this. If anyone knew the inside stories of the battles
      that have shaken Wall Street, he would find that many of them had some
      such beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said this casually, and with nothing in particular in mind. He
      was not watching his friend closely, and he did not see the effect which
      his words had produced upon her. He led the conversation into other
      channels; and he had entirely forgotten the matter the next day, when he
      received a telephone call from Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a week since he had written to Smith and Hanson, the lawyers,
      in regard to the sale of her stock. &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;no letter from
      those people yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was talking about it with a friend this morning, and he made a
      suggestion that I thought was important. Don't you think it might be well
      to find out whom they are representing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would that do?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might help us to get an idea of the prospects,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I fancy
      they know who wants to sell the stock, and we ought to know who is
      thinking of buying it. Suppose you write them that you don't care to
      negotiate with agents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am in no position to do that,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I have already set
      the people a figure, and they have not replied. We should only weaken our
      position by writing again. It would be much better to try to interest
      someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would like to know very much who made that offer,&rdquo; Lucy insisted.
      &ldquo;I have heard rumours about the stock, and I really would like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reiterated this statement several times, and seemed to be very keen
      about it; Montague wondered a little who had been talking to her, and what
      she had heard. But warned by what the Major had told him, he did not ask
      these questions over the 'phone. He answered, finally, &ldquo;I think you are
      making a mistake, but I will do what you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he sat down and wrote a note to Messrs. Smith and Hanson, and said that
      he would like to have a consultation with a member of their firm. He sent
      this note by messenger, and an hour or so later a wiry little person, with
      a much-wrinkled face and a shrewd look in his eyes, came into his office
      and introduced himself as Mr. Hanson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been talking with my client about the matter of the Northern
      Mississippi stock,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;You know, perhaps, that this road was
      organised under somewhat unusual circumstances; most of the stockholders
      were personal friends of our family. For this reason my client would
      prefer not to deal with an agent, if it can possibly be arranged. I wish
      to find out whether your client would consent to deal directly with the
      owner of the stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague finished what he had to say, although while he was speaking he
      noticed that Mr. Hanson was staring at him with very evident astonishment.
      Before he finished, this had changed to a slight sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a trick is this you are trying to play on me?&rdquo; the man
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague was too much taken aback to be angry. He simply stared. &ldquo;I don't
      understand you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't, eh?&rdquo; said the other, laughing in his face. &ldquo;Well, it seems I
      know more than you think I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your client no longer has the stock that you are talking about,&rdquo; said the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague caught his breath. &ldquo;No longer has the stock!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Hanson. &ldquo;She sold it three days ago.&rdquo; Then, unable
      to deny himself the satisfaction, he added, &ldquo;She sold it to Stanley Ryder.
      And if you want to know any more about it, she sold it for a hundred and
      sixty thousand dollars, and he gave her a six months' note for a hundred
      and forty thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was utterly dumfounded. He could do nothing but stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident to the other man that his emotion was genuine, and he
      smiled sarcastically. &ldquo;Evidently, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have been
      permitting your client to take advantage of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague caught himself together, and bowed politely. &ldquo;I owe you an
      apology, Mr. Hanson,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice. &ldquo;I can only assure you that
      I was entirely helpless in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose and bade the man good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door of his office was closed, he caught at the chair by his desk
      to steady himself, and stood staring in front of him. &ldquo;To Stanley Ryder!&rdquo;
       he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the 'phone, and called up his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is it true that you have sold that stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard her give a gasp. &ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;you are going to be angry with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please answer me!&rdquo; he cried again. &ldquo;Have you sold that stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Allan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I didn't mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care to discuss the matter on the telephone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will
      stop in to see you this afternoon on my way home. Please be in, because it
      is important.&rdquo; And then he hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called at the time he had set, and Lucy was waiting for him. She looked
      pale, and very much distressed. She sat in a chair, and neither arose to
      greet him nor spoke to him, but simply gazed into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very sombre face. &ldquo;This thing has given me a great deal of pain,&rdquo;
       said Montague; &ldquo;and I don't want to prolong it any more than necessary. I
      have thought the matter over, and my mind is made up, so there need be no
      discussion. It will not be possible for me to have anything further to do
      with your affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy gave a gasp: &ldquo;Oh, Allan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a valise containing all her papers. &ldquo;I have brought everything up
      to date,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are all the accounts, and the correspondence.
      Anyone will be able to find exactly how things stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is really cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but there is nothing else that I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did I not have a right to sell that stock to Stanley Ryder?&rdquo; she
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a perfect right to sell it to anyone you pleased,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
      you had no right to ask me to take charge of your affairs, and then to
      keep me in the dark about what you had done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Allan,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;I only sold it three days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that perfectly well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the moment you made up your
      mind to sell it, it was your business to tell me. That, however, is not
      the point. You tried to use me as a cat's-paw to pull chestnuts out of the
      fire for Stanley Ryder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw her wince under the words. &ldquo;Is it not true?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Was it
      not he who told you to have me try to get that information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Allan, of course it was he,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;But don't you see my
      plight? I am not a business woman, and I did not realise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You realised that you were not dealing frankly with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
      is all that I care about, and that is why I am not willing to continue to
      represent you. Stanley Ryder has bought your stock, and Stanley Ryder will
      have to be your adviser in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not meant to discuss the matter with her any further, but he saw
      how profoundly he had hurt her, and the old bond between them held him
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you understand what you did to me, Lucy?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Imagine my
      position, talking to Mr. Hanson, I knowing nothing and he knowing
      everything. He knew what you had been paid, and he even knew that you had
      taken a note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy stared at Montague with wide-open eyes. &ldquo;Allan!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what it means,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told you that you could not keep your
      doings secret. Now it will only be a matter of a few days before everybody
      who knows will be whispering that you have permitted Stanley Ryder to do
      this for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Lucy sat staring before her. Then suddenly she
      faced Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Surely&mdash;you understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst out violently, &ldquo;I had a right to sell that stock! Ryder needed
      it. He is going to organise a syndicate, and develop the property. It was
      a simple matter of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it, Lucy,&rdquo; said Montague, in a low voice, &ldquo;but how
      will you persuade the world of that? I told you what would happen if you
      permitted yourself to be intimate with a man like Stanley Ryder. You will
      find out too late what it means. Certainly that incident with Waterman
      ought to have opened your eyes to what people are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy gave a start, and gazed at him with horror in her eyes. &ldquo;Allan!&rdquo; she
      panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that happened to me because Stanley Ryder is my
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Waterman had heard the gossip, and he thought
      that if Ryder was a rich man, he was a ten-times-richer man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague could see the colour mount swiftly over Lucy's throat and face.
      She stood twisting her hands together nervously. &ldquo;Oh, Allan!&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;That is monstrous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not of my making. It is the way the world is. I found it out
      myself, and I tried to point it out to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is horrible!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I will not believe it. I will not yield
      to such things. I will not be coward enough to give up a friend for such a
      motive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the feeling,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I'd stand by you, if it were another
      man than Stanley Ryder. But I know him better than you, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't, Allan, you can't!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I tell you he is a good
      man! He is a man nobody understands&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have heard
      that before. Many men are better than the things they do in this world; at
      any rate, they like to persuade themselves that they are. But you have no
      right to wreck your life out of pity for Ryder. He has made his own
      reputation, and if he had any real care for you, he would not ask you to
      sacrifice yourself to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not ask me to,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;What I have done, I have done of my
      own free will. I believe in him, and I will not believe the horrible
      things that you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;then you will have to go your own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke calmly, though really his heart was wrung with grief. He knew
      exactly the sort of conversation by which Stanley Ryder had brought Lucy
      to this state of mind. He could have shattered the beautiful image of
      himself which Ryder had conjured up; but he could not bear to do it.
      Perhaps it was an instinct which guided him&mdash;he knew that Lucy was in
      love with the man, and that no facts that anyone could bring would make
      any difference to her. All he could say was, &ldquo;You will have to find out
      for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with one more look at her pitiful face of misery, he turned and
      went away, without even touching her hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was now well on in May, and most of the people of Montague's
      acquaintance had moved out to their country places; and those who were
      chained to their desks had yachts or automobiles or private cars, and made
      the trip into the country every afternoon. Montague was invited to spend
      another week at Eldridge Devon's, where Alice had been for a week; but he
      could not spare the time until Saturday afternoon, when he made the trip
      up the Hudson in Devon's new three-hundred-foot steam-yacht, the Triton.
      Some unkind person had described Devon to Montague as &ldquo;a human yawn&rdquo;; but
      he appeared to have a very keen interest in life that Saturday afternoon.
      He had been seized by a sudden conviction that a new and but little
      advertised automobile had proven its superiority to any of the seventeen
      cars which he at present maintained in his establishment. He had got three
      of these new cars, and while Montague sat upon the quarter-deck of the
      Triton and gazed at the magnificent scenery of the river, he had in his
      ear the monotonous hum of Devon's voice, discussing annular ball-bearings
      and water-jacketed cylinders.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the new cars met them at Devon's private pier, and swept them over
      the hill to the mansion. The Devon place had never looked more wonderful
      to Montague than it did just then, with fruit trees in full blossom, and
      the wonder of springtime upon everything. For miles about one might see
      hillsides that were one unbroken stretch of luscious green lawn. But alas,
      Eldridge Devon had no interest in these hills, except to pursue a
      golf-ball over them. Montague never felt more keenly the pitiful quality
      of the people among whom he found himself than when he stood upon the
      portico of this house&mdash;a portico huge enough to belong to some fairy
      palace in a dream&mdash;and gazed at the sweeping vista of the Hudson over
      the heads of Mrs. Billy Alden and several of her cronies, playing bridge.

      After luncheon, he went for a stroll with Alice, and she told him how she
      had been passing the time. &ldquo;Young Curtiss was here for a couple of days,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Prentice's nephew?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He told me he had met you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He struck me as a sensible chap,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him very much,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;I think we shall be friends. He is
      interesting to talk to; you know he was in a militia regiment that went to
      Cuba, and also he's been a cowboy, and all sorts of exciting things. We
      took a walk the other morning, and he told me some of his adventures. They
      say he's quite a successful lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in a very successful firm,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;And he'd hardly have
      got there unless he had ability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a great friend of Laura Hegan's,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;She was over here to
      spend the day. She doesn't approve of many people, so that is a
      compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague spoke of a visit which he had paid to Laura Hegan, at one of the
      neighbouring estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had quite a talk with her,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;And she invited me to
      luncheon, and took me driving. I like her better than I thought I would.
      Don't you like her, Allan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't say that I really know her,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I thought I might
      like her, but she did not happen to like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could that be?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague smiled. &ldquo;Tastes are different,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must be some reason,&rdquo; protested Alice. &ldquo;For she looks at many
      things in the same way that you do. I told her I thought she would be
      interested to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't say anything,&rdquo; answered Alice; and then suddenly she turned to
      him. &ldquo;I am sure you must know some reason. I wish you would tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything definite,&rdquo; Montague answered. &ldquo;I have always
      imagined it had to do with Mrs. Winnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mrs. Winnie!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice, in perplexing wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she heard gossip and believed it,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is a shame!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Why don't you tell her the
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> tell her?&rdquo; laughed Montague. &ldquo;I have no reason for telling her.
      She doesn't care anything in particular about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment or two. &ldquo;I thought of it once or twice,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;For it made me rather angry at first. I saw myself going up to her,
      and startling her with the statement, 'What you believe about me is not
      true!' Then again, I thought I might write her a letter and tell her. But
      of course it would be absurd; she would never acknowledge that she had
      believed anything, and she would think I was impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe she would do anything of the sort,&rdquo; Alice answered. &ldquo;At
      least, not if she meant what she said to me. She was talking about people
      one met in Society, and how tiresome and conventional it all was. 'No one
      ever speaks the truth or deals frankly with you,' she said. 'All the men
      spend their time in paying you compliments about your looks. They think
      that is all a woman cares about. The more I come to know them, the less I
      think of them.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;One cannot feel comfortable knowing a
      girl in her position. Her father is powerful, and some day she will be
      enormously rich herself; and the people who gather about her are seeking
      to make use of her. I was interested in her when I first met her. But when
      I learned more about the world in which she lives, I shrank from even
      talking to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is rather unfair to her,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;Suppose all decent people
      felt that way. And she is really quite easy to know. She told me about
      some charities she is interested in. She goes down into the slums, on the
      East Side, and teaches poor children. It seemed to me a wonderfully daring
      sort of thing, but she laughed when I said so. She says those people are
      just the same as other people, when you come to know them; you get used to
      their ways, and then it does not seem so terrible and far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine it would be so,&rdquo; said Montague, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father came over to meet her,&rdquo; Alice added. &ldquo;She said that was the
      first time he had been out of the city in six months. Just fancy working
      so hard, and with all the money he has! What in the world do you suppose
      he wants more for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose it is the money,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's the power. And when you
      have so much money, you have to work hard to keep other people from taking
      it away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly looks as if he ought to be able to protect himself,&rdquo; said
      the girl. &ldquo;His face is so grim and forbidding. You would hardly think he
      could smile, to look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very pleasant, when you know him,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He remembered you, and asked about you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Wasn't it he who was
      going to buy Lucy Dupree's stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke to him about it,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but nothing came of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause. &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; said Alice, suddenly, &ldquo;what is this I
      hear about Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People are talking about her and Mr. Ryder. I overheard Mrs. Landis
      yesterday. It's outrageous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague did hot know what to say. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;but I think that Victoria Landis is a
      horrible woman. I know she herself does exactly as she pleases. And she
      tells such shocking stories&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; asked the other, after a pause, &ldquo;because you've given up Lucy's
      business affairs, are we to have nothing to do with her at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I don't imagine she will care to see me. I
      have told her about the mistake she's making, and she chooses to go her
      own way. So what more can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      That evening Montague found himself settled on a sofa next to Mrs. Billy
      Alden. &ldquo;What's this I hear about your friend, Mrs. Taylor?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said he, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fascinating widow seems to be throwing herself away,&rdquo; continued the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vivie Patton told me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;She's an old flame of Stanley Ryder's,
      you know; and so I imagine it came directly from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was dumb; he could think of nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Billy. &ldquo;She is really a charming creature. And
      it will hurt her, you know&mdash;she is a stranger, and it's a trifle too
      sudden. Is that the Mississippi way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague forced himself to say, &ldquo;Lucy is her own mistress.&rdquo; But his feeble
      impulse toward conversation was checked by Mrs. Billy's prompt response,
      &ldquo;Vivie said she was Stanley Ryder's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand how you feel,&rdquo; continued the great lady, after a pause.
      &ldquo;Everybody will be talking about it.&mdash;Your friend Reggie Mann heard
      what Vivie said, and he will see to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reggie Mann is no friend of mine,&rdquo; said Montague, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. &ldquo;How in the world do you stand that man?&rdquo; he asked, by
      way of changing the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Reggie fills his place,&rdquo; was the reply. And Mrs. Billy gazed about
      the room. &ldquo;You see all these women?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take them in the morning
      and put half a dozen of them together in one room; they all hate each
      other like poison, and there are no men around, and there is nothing to
      do; and how are you to keep them from quarrelling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Reggie's role?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. He sees a spark fly, and he jumps up and cracks a joke. It
      doesn't make any difference what he does&mdash;I've known him to crow like
      a rooster, or stumble over his own feet&mdash;anything to raise a laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you afraid these epigrams may reach your victim?&rdquo; asked Montague,
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what they are intended to do,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judge you have not many enemies,&rdquo; added Mrs. Billy, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No especial ones,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you should cultivate some. Enemies are the spice of
      life. I mean it, really,&rdquo; she declared, as she saw him smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had never thought of it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never known what it is to get into a really good fight? You see,
      you are conventional, and you don't like to acknowledge it. But what is
      there that wakes one up more than a good, vigorous hatred? Some day you
      will realise it&mdash;the chief zest in life is to go after somebody who
      hates you, and to get him down and see him squirm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose he gets you down?&rdquo; interposed Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you mustn't let him! That is what you go into the fight
      for. Get after him, and do him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds rather barbarous,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;it's the highest reach of
      civilisation. That is what Society is for&mdash;the cultivation of the art
      of hatred. It is the survival of the fittest in a new realm. You study
      your victim, you find out his weaknesses and his foibles, and you know
      just where to plant your sting. You learn what he wants, and you take it
      away from him. You choose your allies carefully, and you surround him and
      overwhelm him; then when you get through with him, you go after another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Billy glanced about her at the exquisite assemblage in Mrs.
      Devon's Louis Seize drawing-room. &ldquo;What do you suppose these people are
      here for to-night?&rdquo; she asked.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      A weekor two had passed, when one day Oliver called his brother on the
      'phone. &ldquo;Have you or Alice any engagement this evening?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I want
      to bring a friend around to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; inquired Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody you have heard of,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;But I want you to meet him. You
      will think he's rather queer, but I will explain to you afterwards. Tell
      Alice to take my word for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague delivered the message, and at seven o'clock they went downstairs.
      In the reception room they met Oliver and his friend, and it was all that
      Montague could do to repress a look of consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the personage was Mr. Gamble. He was a little man, a trifle
      over five feet high, and so fat that one wondered how he could get about
      alone; his chin and neck were a series of rolls of fat. His face was round
      like a full moon, and out of it looked two little eyes like those of a
      pig. It was only after studying them for a while that one discovered that
      they twinkled shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gamble was altogether the vulgarest-looking personage that Alice
      Montague had ever met. He put out a fat little hand to her, and she
      touched it gingerly, and then gazed at Oliver and his brother in helpless
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening. Good evening,&rdquo; he began volubly. &ldquo;I am charmed to meet you.
      Mr. Montague, I have heard so much about you from your brother that I feel
      as if we were old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause. &ldquo;Shall we go into the dining-room?&rdquo; asked
      Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not much relish the stares which would follow them, but he could
      see no way out of the difficulty. They went into the room and seated
      themselves, Montague wondering in a flash whether Mr. Gamble's arms would
      be long enough to reach to the table in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A warm evening,&rdquo; he said, puffing slightly. &ldquo;I have been on the train all
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gamble comes from Pittsburg,&rdquo; interposed Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Montague, striving to make conversation. &ldquo;Are you in
      business there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am out of business,&rdquo; said Mr. Gamble, with a smile. &ldquo;Made my pile,
      so to speak, and got out. I want to see the world a bit before I get too
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter came to take their orders; in the meantime Montague darted an
      indignant glance at his brother, who sat and smiled serenely. Then
      Montague caught Alice's eye, and he could almost hear her saying to him,
      &ldquo;What in the world am I going to talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it proved not very difficult to talk with the gentleman from
      Pittsburg. He appeared to know all the gossip of the Metropolis, and he
      cheerfully supplied the topics of conversation. He had been to Palm Beach
      and Hot Springs during the winter, and told about what he had seen there;
      he was going to Newport in the summer, and he talked about the prospects
      there. If he had the slightest suspicion of the fact that all his
      conversation was not supremely interesting to Montague and his cousin, he
      gave no hint of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had disposed of the elaborate dinner which Oliver ordered, Mr.
      Gamble proposed that they visit one of the theatres. He had a box all
      ready, it seemed, and Oliver accepted for Alice before Montague could say
      a word for her. He spoke for himself, however,&mdash;he had important work
      to do, and must be excused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went upstairs and shook off his annoyance and plunged into his work.
      Sometime after midnight, when he had finished, he went out for a breath of
      fresh air, and as he returned he found Oliver and his friend standing in
      the lobby of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Montague?&rdquo; said Gamble. &ldquo;Glad to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice has just gone upstairs,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;We were going to sit in the
      cafe awhile. Will you join us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Mr. Gamble, cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague went because he wanted to have a talk with Oliver before he went
      to bed that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Dick Ingham?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gamble, as they seated themselves at
      a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Steel man, you mean?&rdquo; asked Montague. &ldquo;No, I never met him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking about him,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Poor chap&mdash;it really
      was hard luck, you know. It wasn't his fault. Did you ever hear the true
      story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Montague, but he knew to what the other referred. Ingham was
      one of the &ldquo;Steel crowd,&rdquo; as they were called, and he had been president
      of the Trust until a scandal had forced his resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an old friend of mine,&rdquo; said Gamble; &ldquo;he told me all about it. It
      began in Paris&mdash;some newspaper woman tried to blackmail him, and he
      had her put in jail for three months. And when she got out again, then the
      papers at home began to get stories about poor Ingham's cutting up. And
      the public went wild, and they made him resign&mdash;just imagine it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamble chuckled so violently that he was seized by a coughing spell, and
      had to signal for a glass of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got a new scandal on their hands now,&rdquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're a lively crowd, the Steel fellows,&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;They want
      to make Davidson resign, too, but he'll fight them. He knows too much! You
      should hear his story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine it's not a very savoury one,&rdquo; said Montague, for lack of
      something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad,&rdquo; said the other, earnestly. &ldquo;I have talked to them
      sometimes, but it don't do any good. I remember Davidson one night: 'Jim,'
      says he, 'a fellow gets a whole lot of money, and he buys him everything
      he wants, until at last he buys a woman, and then his trouble begins. If
      you're buying pictures, there's an end to it&mdash;you get your walls
      covered sooner or later. But you never can satisfy a woman.'&rdquo; And Mr.
      Gamble shook his head. &ldquo;Too bad, too bad,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in the steel business yourself?&rdquo; asked Montague, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, oil was my line. I've been fighting the Trust, and last year they
      bought me out, and now I'm seeing the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gamble relapsed into thought again. &ldquo;I never went in for that sort of
      thing myself,&rdquo; he said meditatively; &ldquo;I am a married man, I am, and one
      woman is enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your family in New York?&rdquo; asked Montague, in an effort to change the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, they live in Pittsburg,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I've got four daughters&mdash;all
      in college. They're stunning girls, I tell you&mdash;I'd like you to meet
      them, Mr. Montague.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be pleased,&rdquo; said Montague, writhing inwardly. But a few minutes
      later, to his immense relief, Mr. Gamble arose, and bade him good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague saw him clamber laboriously into his automobile, and then he
      turned to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what in the devil does this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean?&rdquo; asked Oliver, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man,&rdquo; exclaimed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought you would like to meet him,&rdquo; said Oliver; &ldquo;he is an
      interesting chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in no mood for fooling,&rdquo; said his brother, angrily. &ldquo;Why in the
      world should you insult Alice by introducing such a man to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are talking nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver; &ldquo;he knows the best
      people&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you meet him?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Landis introduced him to me first. She met him through a cousin of
      hers, a naval officer. He has been living in Brooklyn this winter. He
      knows all the navy people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, anyway?&rdquo; demanded Montague, impatiently. &ldquo;Is it some business
      affair that you are interested in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Oliver, smiling cheerfully&mdash;&ldquo;purely social. He wants
      to be introduced about, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to put him into Society, by any chance?&rdquo; asked the other,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are warm, as the children say,&rdquo; laughed his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague stared at him. &ldquo;Oliver, you don't mean it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That fellow
      in Society!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;if he wants to. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his wife and his daughters!&rdquo; exclaimed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's not it&mdash;the family stays in Pittsburg. It's only himself
      this time. All the same,&rdquo; Oliver added, after a pause, &ldquo;I'd like to wager
      you that if you were to meet Jim Gamble's four prize daughters, you'd find
      it hard to tell them from the real thing. They've been to a swell
      boarding-school, and they've had everything that money can buy them. My
      God, but I'm tired of hearing about their accomplishments!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; the other protested, &ldquo;that your friends will
      stand for a man like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them will. He's got barrels of money, you know. And he
      understands the situation perfectly&mdash;he won't make many mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in the world does he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; demanded Montague; &ldquo;you are getting money for this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver smiled a long and inscrutable smile. &ldquo;You don't imagine that I'm in
      love with him, I trust. I thought you'd be interested to see the game,
      that's why I introduced him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But you have no right to inflict
      such a man upon Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stuff!&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;She'll meet him at Newport this summer, anyway.
      How could I introduce him anywhere else, if I wasn't willing to introduce
      him here? He won't hurt Alice. He gave her a good time this evening, and I
      wager she'll like him before he gets through. He's really a good-natured
      chap; the chief trouble with him is that he gets confidential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague relapsed into silence, and Oliver changed the subject. &ldquo;It seems
      too bad about Lucy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is there nothing we can do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is simply ruining herself,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;I've been trying to get
      Reggie Mann to have her introduced to Mrs. Devon, but he says he wouldn't
      dare to take the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I presume not,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a shame,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;I thought Mrs. Billy Alden would ask her to
      Newport this summer, but now I don't believe she'll have a thing to do
      with her. Lucy will find she knows nobody except Stanley Ryder and his
      crowd. She has simply thrown herself away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;That's Lucy's way,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she'll have a good time,&rdquo; added the other. &ldquo;Ryder is generous,
      at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he's making barrels of money,&rdquo; said Oliver; then he added,
      longingly, &ldquo;My God, I wish I had a trust company to play with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a trust company particularly?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the easiest graft that's going,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;It's some dodge or
      other by which they evade the banking laws, and the money comes rolling in
      in floods. You've noticed their advertisements, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed them,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is adding something over a million a month, I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds very attractive,&rdquo; said the other; and added, drily, &ldquo;I suppose
      Ryder feels as if he owned it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might just as well own it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;If I were going into Wall
      Street to make money, I'd rather have the control of fifty millions than
      the absolute ownership of ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Oliver remarked after a moment, &ldquo;the Prentices have asked
      Alice up to Newport. Alice seems to be quite taken with that young chap,
      Curtiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes around a good deal,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;He seems a very decent
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But he hasn't enough money to take care of a
      girl like Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that's a question for Alice to consider.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONE day, a month or so later, Montague, to his great surprise, received a
      letter from Stanley Ryder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you make it convenient to call at my office sometime this
      afternoon?&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;I wish to talk over with you a business proposition
      which I believe you will find of great advantage to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he wants to buy my Northern Mississippi stock,&rdquo; he said to
      himself, as he called up Ryder on the 'phone, and made an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that he had ever been inside the building of the
      Gotham Trust Company, and he gazed about him at the overwhelming
      magnificence&mdash;huge gates of bronze and walls of exquisite marble.
      Ryder's own office was elaborate and splendid, and he himself a picture of
      aristocratic elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted Montague cordially, and talked for a few minutes about the
      state of the market, and the business situation, in the meantime twirling
      a pencil in his hand and watching his visitor narrowly. At last he began,
      &ldquo;Mr. Montague, I have for some time been working over a plan which I think
      will interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very pleased to hear of it,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you know,&rdquo; said Ryder, &ldquo;that I bought from Mrs. Taylor her
      holdings in the Northern Mississippi Railroad. I bought them because I was
      of the opinion that the road ought to be developed, and I believed that I
      could induce someone to take the matter up. I have found the right
      parties, I think, and the plans are now being worked out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the other, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea, Mr. Montague, is to extend the railroad according to the old
      plan, with which you are familiar. Before we took the matter up, we
      approached the holders of the remainder of the stock, most of whom, I
      suppose, are known to you. We made them, through our agents, a proposition
      to buy their stock at what we considered a fair price; and we have
      purchased about five thousand shares additional. The prices quoted on the
      balance were more than we cared to pay, in consideration of the very great
      cost of the improvements we proposed to undertake. Our idea is now to make
      a new proposition to these other shareholders. The annual stockholders'
      meeting takes place next month. At this meeting will be brought up the
      project for the issue of twenty thousand additional shares, with the
      understanding that as much of this new stock as is not taken by the
      present shareholders is to go to us. As I assume that few of them will
      take their allotments, that will give us control of the road; you can
      understand, of course, that our syndicate would not undertake the venture
      unless it could obtain control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague nodded his assent to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this meeting,&rdquo; said Ryder, &ldquo;we shall propose a ticket of our own for
      the new board of directors. We are in hopes that as our proposition will
      be in the interest of every stockholder, this ticket will be elected. We
      believe that the road needs a new policy, and a new management entirely;
      if a majority of the stockholders can be brought to our point of view, we
      shall take control, and put in a new president.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder paused for a moment, to let this information sink into his auditor's
      mind; then, fixing his gaze upon him narrowly, he continued: &ldquo;What I
      wished to see you about, Mr. Montague, was to make you a proposal to
      assist us in putting through this project. We should like you, in the
      first place, to act as our representative, in consultation with our
      regular attorneys. We should like you to interview privately the
      stockholders of the road, and explain to them our projects, and vouch for
      our good intentions. If you can see your way to undertake this work for
      us, we should be glad to place you upon the proposed board of directors;
      and as soon as we have matters in our hands, we should ask you to become
      president of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague gave an inward start; but practice had taught him to keep from
      letting his surprise manifest itself very much. He sat for a minute in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a little surprised at such a proposition from
      you, seeing that you know so little about me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know more than you suppose, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; said the other, with a
      smile. &ldquo;You may rest assured that I have not broached such a matter to you
      without making inquiries, and satisfying myself that you were the proper
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very pleasant to be told that,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;But I must remind
      you, also, that I am not a railroad man, and have had no experience
      whatever in such matters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary that you should be a railroad man,&rdquo; was the answer.
      &ldquo;One can hire talent of that kind at market prices. What we wish is a man
      of careful and conservative temper, and, above all, a man of
      thorough-going honesty; someone who will be capable of winning the
      confidence of the stockholders, and of keeping it. It seemed to us that
      you possessed these qualifications. Also, of course, you have the
      advantage of being familiar with the neighbourhood, and of knowing
      thoroughly the local conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague thought for a while longer. &ldquo;The offer is a very flattering one,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;and I need hardly tell you that it interests me. But before I
      could properly consider the matter, there is one thing I should have to
      know&mdash;that is, who are the members of this syndicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would it be necessary to know that?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am to lend my reputation to their project, and I should have to
      know the character of the men that I was dealing with.&rdquo; Montague was
      gazing straight into the other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand, of course,&rdquo; replied Ryder, &ldquo;that in a matter of this
      sort it is necessary to proceed with caution. We cannot afford to talk
      about what we are going to do. We have enemies who will do what they can
      to check us at every step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you tell me will, of course, be confidential,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that perfectly well,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But I wished first to
      get some idea of your attitude toward the project&mdash;whether or not you
      would be at liberty to take up this work and to devote yourself to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see no reason why I should not,&rdquo; Montague answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Ryder, &ldquo;that the proposition can be judged largely
      upon its own merits. It is a proposition to put through an important
      public improvement; a road which is in a broken-down and practically
      bankrupt condition is to be taken up, and thoroughly reorganised, and put
      upon its feet. It is to have a vigorous and honest administration, a new
      and adequate equipment, and a new source of traffic. The business of the
      Mississippi Steel Company, as you doubtless know, is growing with
      extraordinary rapidity. All this, it seems to me, is a work about the
      advisability of which there can be no question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;and I will meet the persons who are
      interested and talk out matters with them; and if their plans are such as
      I can approve, I should be very glad to join with them, and to do
      everything in my power to make a success of the enterprise. As you
      doubtless know, I have five hundred shares of the stock myself, and I
      should be glad to become a member of the syndicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I had in mind to propose to you,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I
      anticipate no difficulty in satisfying you&mdash;the project is largely of
      my own originating, and my own reputation will be behind it. The Gotham
      Trust Company will lend its credit to the enterprise so far as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder said this with just a trifle of hauteur, and Montague felt that
      perhaps he had spoken too strenuously. No one could sit in Ryder's office
      and not be impressed by its atmosphere of magnificence; after all, it was
      here, and its seventy or eighty million dollars of deposits were real, and
      this serene and aristocratic gentleman was the master of them. And what
      reason had Montague for his hesitation, except the gossip of idle and
      cynical Society people?
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever doubts he himself might have, he needed to reflect but a moment
      to realise that his friends in Mississippi would not share them. If he
      went back home with the name of Stanley Ryder and the Gotham Trust Company
      to back him, he would come as a conqueror with tidings of triumph, and all
      the old friends of the family would rush to follow his suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryder waited awhile, perhaps to let these reflections sink in. Finally he
      continued: &ldquo;I presume, Mr. Montague, that you know something about the
      Mississippi Steel Company. The steel situation is a peculiar one. Prices
      are kept at an altogether artificial level, and there is room for large
      profits to competitors of the Trust. But those who go into the business
      commonly find themselves unexpectedly handicapped. They cannot get the
      credit they want; orders overwhelm them in floods, but Wall Street will
      not put up money to help them. They find all kinds of powerful interests
      arrayed against them; there are raids upon their securities in the market,
      and mysterious rumours begin to circulate. They find suits brought against
      them which tend to injure their credit. And sometimes they will find
      important papers missing, important witnesses sailing for Europe, and so
      on. Then their most efficient employees will be bought up; their very
      bookkeepers and office-boys will be bribed, and all the secrets of their
      business passed on to their enemies. They will find that the railroads do
      not treat them squarely; cars will be slow in coming, and all kinds of
      petty annoyances will be practised. You know what the rebate is, and you
      can imagine the part which that plays. In these and a hundred other ways,
      the path of the independent steel manufacturer is made difficult. And now,
      Mr. Montague, this is a project to extend a railroad which will be of vast
      service to the chief competitor of the Steel Trust. I believe that you are
      man of the world enough to realise that this improvement would have been
      made long ago, if the Steel Trust had not been able to prevent it. And
      now, the time has come when that project is to be put through in spite of
      every opposition that the Trust can bring; and I have come to you because
      I believe that you are a man to be counted on in such a fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said Montague, quietly; &ldquo;and you are right in your
      supposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Ryder. &ldquo;Then I will tell you that the syndicate of which
      I speak is composed of myself and John S. Price, who has recently acquired
      control of the Mississippi Steel Company. You will find out without
      difficulty what Price's reputation is; he is the one man in the country
      who has made any real headway against the Trust. The business of the
      Mississippi Company has almost doubled in the past year, and there is no
      limit to what it can do, except the size of the plant and the ability of
      the railroads to handle its product. This new plan would have been taken
      up through the Company, but for the fact that the Company's capital and
      credit is involved in elaborate extensions. Price has furnished some of
      the capital personally, and I have raised the balance; and what we want
      now is an honest man to whom we can entrust this most important project, a
      man who will take the road in hand and put it on its feet, and make it of
      some service in the community. You are the man we have selected, and if
      the proposition appeals to you, why, we are ready to do business with you
      without delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two Montague was silent; then he said: &ldquo;I appreciate your
      confidence, Mr. Ryder, and what you say appeals to me. But the matter is a
      very important one to me, as you can readily understand, and so I will ask
      you to give me until to-morrow to make up my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Ryder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague's first thought was of General Prentice. &ldquo;Come to me any time you
      need advice,&rdquo; the General had said; so Montague went down to his office.
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about John S. Price?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know him very well personally,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I know him by
      reputation. He is a daring Wall Street operator, and he's been very
      successful, I am told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price began life as a cowboy, I understand,&rdquo; continued the General, after
      a pause. &ldquo;Then he went in for mines. Ten or fifteen years ago we used to
      know him as a silver man. Several years ago there was a report that he had
      been raiding Mississippi Steel, and had got control. That was rather
      startling news, for everybody knew that the Trust was after it. He seems
      to have fought them to a standstill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds interesting,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price was brought up in a rough school,&rdquo; said the General, with a smile.
      &ldquo;He has a tongue like a whip-lash. I remember once I attended a creditors'
      meeting of the American Stove Company, which had got into trouble, and
      Price started off from the word go. 'Mr. Chairman,' he said, 'when I come
      into the office of an industrial corporation, and see a stock ticker
      behind the president's chair with the carpet worn threadbare in front of
      it, I know what's the matter with that corporation without asking another
      word.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to know about him for?&rdquo; asked the General, after he had
      got through laughing over this recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a case I'm concerned in,&rdquo; the other answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you who knows about him,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;Harry Curtiss.
      William E. Davenant has done law business for Price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Then probably I shall meet Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you a better person yet,&rdquo; said the other, after a moment's
      thought. &ldquo;Ask your friend Mrs. Alden; she knows Price intimately, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Montague sent up a note to Mrs. Billy, and the reply came, &ldquo;Come up to
      dinner. I am not going out.&rdquo; And so, late in the afternoon, he was
      ensconced in a big leather armchair in Mrs. Billy's private drawing-room,
      and listening to an account of the owner of the Mississippi Steel Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny Price?&rdquo; said the great lady. &ldquo;Yes, I know him. It all depends
      whether you are going to have him for a friend or an enemy. His mother was
      Irish, and he is built after her. If he happens to take a fancy to you,
      he'll die for you; and if you make him hate you, you will hear a greater
      variety of epithets than you ever supposed the language contained.&mdash;I
      first met him in Washington,&rdquo; Mrs. Billy went on, reminiscently; &ldquo;that was
      fifteen years ago, when my brother was in Congress. I think I told you
      once how Davy paid forty thousand dollars for the nomination, and went to
      Congress. It was the year of a Democratic landslide, and they could have
      elected Reggie Mann if they had felt like it. I went to Washington to live
      the next winter, and Price was there with a whole army of lobbyists,
      fighting for free silver. That was before the craze, you know, when silver
      was respectable; and Price was the Silver King. I saw the inside of
      American government that winter, I can assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Democratic party had been elected on a low tariff platform,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Billy; &ldquo;and it sold out bag and baggage to the corporations. Money
      was as free as water&mdash;my brother could have got his forty thousand
      back three times over. It was the Steel crowd that bossed the job, you
      know&mdash;William Roberts used to come down from Pittsburg every two or
      three days, and he had a private telephone wire the rest of the time. I
      have always said it was the Steel Trust that clamped the tariff swindle on
      the American people, and that's held it there ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Price do with his silver mines?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sold them,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and just in the nick of time. He was on the
      inside in the campaign of '96, and I remember one night he came to dinner
      at our house and told us that the Republican party had raised ten or
      fifteen million dollars to buy the election. 'That's the end of silver,'
      he said, and he sold out that very month, and he's been freelancing it in
      Wall Street ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you met him yet?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Billy, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a character,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I've heard Davy tell about the first time
      he struck New York&mdash;as a miner, with huge wads of greenbacks in his
      pockets. He spent his money like a 'coal-oil Johnny,' as the phrase is&mdash;a
      hundred-dollar bill for a shine, and that sort of thing. And he'd go on
      the wildest debauches; you can have no idea of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he that kind of a man?&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He used to be,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But one day he had something the matter
      with him, and he went to a doctor, and the doctor told him something, I
      don't know what, and he shut down like a steel trap. Now he never drinks a
      drop, and he lives on one meal a day and a cup of coffee. But he still
      goes with the old crowd&mdash;I don't believe there is a politician or a
      sporting-man in town that Johnny Price does not know. He sits in their
      haunts and talks with them until all sorts of hours in the morning, but I
      can never get him to come to my dinner-parties. 'My people are human,' he
      will say; 'yours are sawdust.' Sometime, if you want to see New York, just
      get Johnny Price to take you about and introduce you to his bookmakers and
      burglars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague meditated for a while over his friend's picture. &ldquo;Somehow or
      other,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it doesn't sound much like the president of a
      hundred-million-dollar corporation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Billy, &ldquo;but Price will be at his desk bright
      and early the next morning, and every man in the office will be there,
      too. And if you think he won't have his wits about him, just you try to
      fool him on some deal, and see. Let me tell you a little that I know about
      the fight he has made with the Mississippi Steel Company.&rdquo; And she went on
      to tell. The upshot of her telling was that Montague borrowed the use of
      her desk and wrote a note to Stanley Ryder. &ldquo;From my inquiries about John
      S. Price, I gather that he makes steel. With the understanding that I am
      to make a railroad and carry his steel, I have concluded to accept your
      proposition, subject, of course, to a satisfactory arrangement as to
      terms.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE next morning Montague had an interview with John S. Price in his Wall
      Street office, and was retained as counsel in connection with the new
      reorganisation. He accepted the offer, and in the afternoon he called by
      appointment at the law-offices of William E. Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person Montague met there was Harry Curtiss, who greeted him
      with eagerness. &ldquo;I was pleased to death when I heard that you were in on
      this deal,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we shall have some work to do together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About the table in the consultation room of Davenant's offices were seated
      Ryder and Price, and Montague and Curtiss, and, finally, William E.
      Davenant. Davenant was one of the half-dozen highest-paid corporation
      lawyers in the Metropolis. He was a tall, lean man, whose clothing hung
      upon him like rags upon a scare-crow. One of his shoulders was a trifle
      higher than the other, and his long neck invariably hung forward, so that
      his thin, nervous face seemed always to be peering about. One had a sense
      of a pair of keen eyes, behind which a restless brain was constantly
      plotting. Some people rated Davenant as earning a quarter of a million a
      year, and it was his boast that no one who made money according to plans
      which he approved had ever been made to give any of it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In curious contrast was the figure of Price, who looked like a
      well-dressed pugilist. He was verging on stoutness, and his face was
      round, but underneath the superfluous flesh one could see the jaw of a man
      of iron will. It was easy to believe that Price had fought his way through
      life. He spoke sharply and to the point, and he laid bare the subject with
      a few quick strokes, as of a surgeon's knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first question was as to Montague's errand in the South. There was no
      need of buying more stock of the road, for if they got the new stock they
      would have control, and that was all they needed. Montague was to see
      those holders of the stock whom he knew personally, and to represent to
      them that he had succeeded in interesting some Northern capitalists in the
      road, and that they would undertake the improvements on condition that
      their board of directors should be elected. Price produced a list of the
      new directors. They consisted of Montague and Curtiss and Ryder and
      himself; a cousin of the latter's, and two other men, who, as he phrased
      it, were &ldquo;accustomed to help me in that way.&rdquo; That left two places to be
      filled by Montague from among the influential holders of the stock. &ldquo;That
      always pleases,&rdquo; said Price, succinctly, &ldquo;and at the same time we shall
      have an absolute majority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was to be voted an issue of a million dollars' worth of bonds, which
      the Gotham Trust Company would take; also a new issue of twenty thousand
      shares of stock, which was to be offered pro rata to the present
      stock-holders at fifty cents on the dollar. Montague was to state that his
      clients would take any which these stockholders did not want. He was to
      use every effort to keep the plan secret, and would make no attempt to
      obtain the stock-holders' list of the road. The reason for this came out a
      little later, when the subject of the old-time survey was broached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must take steps to get hold of those plans,&rdquo; said Price. &ldquo;In this, as
      well as everything else, we proceed upon the assumption that the present
      administration of the road is crooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next matter to be considered was the charter. &ldquo;When I get a charter
      for a railroad,&rdquo; said Price, &ldquo;I get one that lets me do anything from
      building a toothpick factory to running flying-machines. But the fools who
      drew the charter of the Northern Mississippi got permission to build a
      railroad from Atkin to Opala. So we have to proceed to get an extension.
      While you are down there, Mr. Montague, you will see the job through with
      the Legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague thought for a moment. &ldquo;I don't believe that I have much influence
      with the Legislature,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Price, grimly. &ldquo;We'll furnish the influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here spoke Davenant. &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we can just as well
      arrange this matter without mentioning the Northern Mississippi Railroad
      at all. If the Steel people get wind of this, we are liable to have all
      sorts of trouble; the Governor is their man, as you know. The thing to do
      is to pass a blanket bill, providing that any public-service corporation
      whose charter antedates a certain period may extend its line within
      certain limits and under certain conditions, and so on. I think that I can
      draw a bill that will go through before anybody has an idea what it's
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Price. &ldquo;Do it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they went, from point to point. Price laid down Montague's own
      course of procedure in a few brief sentences. They had just two weeks
      before the stockholders' meeting, and it was arranged that he should start
      for Mississippi upon the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conference was over, Montague rode up town with Harry Curtiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that Davenant said about the Governor?&rdquo; he asked, when they were
      seated in the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor Hannis, you mean?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I don't know so very much
      about it, but there's been some agitation down there against the
      railroads, and Waterman and the Steel crowd put in Governor Hannis to do
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rather staggering to me,&rdquo; said Montague, after a little thought.
      &ldquo;I didn't say anything about it, but you know Governor Hannis is an old
      friend of my father's, and one of the finest men I ever knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I don't doubt that,&rdquo; said Curtiss, easily. &ldquo;They put up these
      fine, respectable old gentlemen. Of course, he's simply a figure-head&mdash;he
      probably has no idea of what he's really doing. You understand, of course,
      that Senator Harmon is the real boss of your State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it said,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;But I never took much stock in
      such statements&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Curtiss. &ldquo;You'd take it if you'd been in my boots. I used to
      do business for old Waterman's Southern railroads, and I've had occasion
      to take messages to Harmon once or twice. New York is the place where you
      find out about this game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not a very pleasant game,&rdquo; said Montague, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't make the rules,&rdquo; said Curtiss. &ldquo;You find you either have to play
      that way or else get out altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man relapsed into silence for a moment, then laughed to
      himself. &ldquo;I know how you feel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I remember when I first came out
      of college, the twinges I used to have. I had my head full of all the
      beautiful maxims of the old Professor of Ethics. And they took me on in
      the legal department of the New York and Hudson Railroad, and we had a
      case&mdash;-some kind of a damage suit; and old Henry Corbin&mdash;their
      chief counsel, you know&mdash;gave me the papers, and then took out of his
      desk a typewritten list of the judges of the Supreme Court of the State.
      'Some of them are marked with red,' he said; 'you can bring the case
      before any of them. They are our judges.' Just fancy, you know! And I as
      innocent as a spring chicken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think things like that would get out in the end,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curtiss shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;How could you prove it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if a certain judge always decided in favour of the railroad&mdash;&rdquo;
       began Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; said Curtiss. &ldquo;Leave that to the judge! Sometimes he'll
      decide against the railroad, but he'll make some ruling that the higher
      courts will be sure to upset, and by that time the other fellow will be
      tired out, and ready to quit. Or else&mdash;here's another way. I remember
      one case that I had that old Corbin told me I'd be sure to win, and I took
      eleven different exceptions, and the judge decided against me on every
      single one. I thought I was gone sure&mdash;but, by thunder, he instructed
      the jury in my favour! It took me a long time to see the shrewdness of
      that; you see, it goes to the higher courts, and they see that the judge
      has given the losing side every advantage, and has decided purely on the
      evidence. And of course they haven't the witnesses before them, and don't
      feel half so well able to judge of the evidence, and so they let the
      decision stand. There are more ways than one to skin a cat, you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't seem to leave much room for justice,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the other responded, &ldquo;Oh, hell! If you'd been in this business as
      long as I have, and seen all the different kinds of shysters that are
      trying to plunder the railroads, you'd not fret about justice. The way the
      public has got itself worked up just at present, you can win almost any
      case you can get before a jury, and there are men who spend all their time
      hunting up cases and manufacturing evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague sat for a while in thought. He muttered, half to himself,
      &ldquo;Governor Hannis! It takes my breath away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get Davenant to tell you about it,&rdquo; said Curtiss, with a laugh. &ldquo;Maybe
      it's not so bad as I imagine. Davenant is cynical on the subject of
      governors, you know. He had an experience a few years ago, when he went up
      to Albany to try to get the Governor to sign a certain bill. The Governor
      went out of his office and left him, and Davenant noticed that a drawer of
      his desk was open, and he looked in, and there was an envelope with fifty
      brand-new one-thousand-dollar bills in it! He didn't know what they were
      there for, but this was a mighty important bill, and he concluded he'd
      take a chance. He put the envelope in his pocket; and then the Governor
      came back, and after some talk about the interests of the public, he told
      him he'd concluded to veto that bill. 'Very well,' Mr. Governor,' said the
      old man, 'I have only this to say,' and he took out the envelope. 'I have
      here fifty new one-thousand-dollar bills, which are yours if you sign that
      measure. On the other hand, if you refuse to sign it, I will take the
      bills to the newspaper men, and tell them what I know about how you got
      them.' And the Governor turned as white as a sheet, and, by God, he signed
      the bill and sent it off to the Legislature while Davenant waited! So you
      can see why he is sceptical about governors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;that was what Price meant when he said he'd
      furnish the influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what he meant,&rdquo; said the other, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like the prospect,&rdquo; Montague responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;What are you going to do about
      it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Your political machines and your offices are in the hands
      of peanut-politicians and grafters who are looking for what's coming to
      them. If you want anything, you have to pay them for it, just the same as
      in any other business. You face the same situation every hour&mdash;'Pay
      or quit.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Curtiss went on, after a pause, &ldquo;take our own case. Here we are,
      and we want to build a little railroad. It's an important work; it's got
      to be done. But we might haunt the lobbies of your State legislature for
      fifty years, and if we didn't put up, we wouldn't get the charter. And, in
      the meantime, what do you suppose the Steel Trust would be doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever thought what such things will lead to?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Curtiss. &ldquo;I've had a fancy that some day the business
      men of the country will have to go into politics and run it on business
      lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other pondered the reply. &ldquo;That sounds simple,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But doesn't
      it mean the overthrow of Republican institutions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it would,&rdquo; said Curtiss. &ldquo;But what's to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any remedy?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't know any remedy,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;but I am looking for one.
      And I can tell you of this, for a start; I value this Republic more than I
      do any business I ever got into yet; and if I come to that dilemma, it
      will be the business that will give way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curtiss was watching him narrowly. He put his hand on his shoulder.
      &ldquo;That's all right, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But take my advice, and don't let
      Davenant hear you say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man rose from his seat. &ldquo;Here's my station,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
      reason is&mdash;it might unsettle his ideas. He's a conservative Democrat,
      you know, and he likes to make speeches at banquets!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN spite of his doubts, Montague returned to his old home, and put through
      the programme as agreed. Just as he had anticipated, he found that he was
      received as a conquering hero by the holders of the Northern Mississippi
      stock. He talked with old Mr. Lee, his cousin, and two or three others of
      his old friends, and he had no difficulty in obtaining their pledges for
      the new ticket. They were all interested, and eager about the future of
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not have to concern himself with the new charter. Davenant drew up
      the bill, and he wrote that a nephew of Senator Harmon's would be able to
      put it through without attracting any attention. All that Montague knew
      was that the bill passed, and was signed by the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the day of the stockholders' meeting. He attended it,
      presenting proxies for the stock of Ryder and Price, and nominated his
      ticket, greatly to the consternation of Mr. Carter, the president of the
      road, who had been a lifelong friend of his family's. The new board of
      directors was elected by the votes of nearly three-fourths of the stock,
      and the new stock issue was voted by the same majority. As none of the
      former stockholders cared to take the new stock, Montague subscribed for
      the whole issue in the name of Ryder and Price, and presented a certified
      check for the necessary deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of these events, of course, created great excitement in the
      neighbourhood; also it did not pass unobserved in New York. Northern
      Mississippi was quoted for the first time on the &ldquo;curb,&rdquo; and there was
      quite a little trading; the stock went up nearly ten points in one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague received this information in a letter from Harry Curtiss. &ldquo;You
      must be prepared to withstand the flatteries of the Steel crowd,&rdquo; he
      wrote. &ldquo;They will be after you before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague judged that he would not mind facing the &ldquo;Steel crowd&rdquo;; but he
      was much troubled by an interview which he had to go through with on the
      day after the meeting. Old Mr. Carter came to see him, and gave him a
      feeble hand to shake, and sat and gazed at him with a pitiful look of
      unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been president of the Northern Mississippi for
      fifteen years, and I have served the road faithfully and devotedly. And
      now&mdash;I want you to tell me&mdash;what does this mean? Am I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague could not remember a time when Mr. Carter had not been a visitor
      at his father's home, and it was painful to see him in his helplessness.
      But there was nothing that could be done about it; he set his lips
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, Mr. Garter,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I am not at liberty to say a
      word to you about the plans of my clients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand, then, that I am to be turned out of my position? I am
      to have no consideration for all that I have done? Surely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; Montague said again, firmly,&mdash;&ldquo;but the
      circumstances at the present time are such that I must ask you to excuse
      me from discussing the matter in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A day or two later Montague received a telegram from Price, instructing
      him to go to Riverton, where the works of the Mississippi Steel Company
      were located, and to meet Mr. Andrews, the president of the Company.
      Montague had been to Riverton several times in his youth, and he
      remembered the huge mills, which were one of the sights of the State. But
      he was not prepared for the enormous development which had since taken
      place. The Mississippi Steel Company had now two huge Bessemer converters,
      in which a volcano of molten flame roared all day and night. It had bought
      up the whole western side of the town, and cleared away half a hundred
      ramshackle dwellings; and here were long rows of coke-ovens, and two huge
      rail-mills, and a plate-mill from which arose sounds like the crashing of
      the day of doom. Everywhere loomed rows of towering chimneys, and pillars
      of rolling black smoke. Little miniature railroad tracks ran crisscross
      about the yards, and engines came puffing and clanking, carrying blazing
      white ingots which the eye could not bear to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite to the entrance of the stockaded yards, the Company had put up a
      new office building, and upon the top floor of this were the president's
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Andrews will be in on the two o'clock train,&rdquo; said his secretary, who
      was evidently expecting the visitor. &ldquo;Will you wait in his office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should like to see the works, if you can arrange it for me,&rdquo;
       said Montague. And so he was provided with a pass and an attendant, and
      made a tour of the yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was interesting to Montague to see the actual property of the
      Mississippi Steel Company. Sitting in comfortable offices in Wall Street
      and exchanging pieces of paper, one had a tendency to lose sight of the
      fact that he was dealing in material things and disposing of the destinies
      of living people. But Montague was now to build and operate a railroad&mdash;to
      purchase real cars and handle real iron and steel; and the thought was in
      his mind that at every step of what he did he wished to keep this reality
      in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a July day, with not a cloud in the sky, and an almost tropical sun
      blazed down upon the works. The sheds and railroad tracks shimmered in the
      heat, and it seemed as if the cinders upon which one trod had been newly
      poured from a fire. In the rooms where the furnaces blazed, Montague could
      not penetrate at all; he could only stand in the doorway, shading his eyes
      from the glare. In each of these infernos toiled hundreds of grimy,
      smoke-stained men, stripped to the waist and streaming with perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed down the long rows of the blast furnaces, great caverns through
      the cracks of which the molten steel shone like lightning. Here the men
      who worked had to have buckets of water poured over them continually, and
      they drank several gallons of beer each day. He went through the
      rail-mills, where the flaming white ingots were caught by huge rollers,
      and tossed about like pancakes, and flattened and squeezed, emerging at
      the other end in the shape of tortured red snakes of amazing length. At
      the far end of the mill one could see them laid out in long rows to cool;
      and as Montague stood and watched them, the thought came to him that these
      were some of the rails which Wyman had ordered, and which had been the
      cause of such dismay in the camp of the Steel Trust!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on to the plate-mill, where giant hammers resounded, and
      steel plates of several inches' thickness were chopped and sliced like
      pieces of cheese. Here the spectator stared about him in bewilderment and
      clung to his guide for safety; huge travelling cranes groaned overhead,
      and infernal engines made deafening clatter upon every side. It was a
      source of never ending wonder that men should be able to work in such
      confusion, with no sense of danger and no consciousness of all the uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague's eye roamed from place to place; then suddenly it was arrested
      by a sight even unusually startling. Across on the other side of the mill
      was a steel shaft, which turned one of the largest of the rollers. It was
      high up in the air, and revolving with unimaginable speed, and Montague
      saw a man with an oil-can in his hand rest the top of a ladder upon this
      shaft, and proceed to climb up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched his guide upon the arm and pointed. &ldquo;Isn't that dangerous?&rdquo; he
      shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's against orders,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;But they will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And even while the words of a reply were upon his lips, something happened
      which turned the sound into a scream of horror. Montague stood with his
      hand still pointing, his whole body turned to stone. Instantaneously, as
      if by the act of a magician, the man upon the ladder had disappeared; and
      instead there was a hazy mist about the shaft, and the ladder tumbling to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one else in the mill appeared to have noticed it. Montague's guide
      leaped forward, dodging a white-hot plate upon its journey to the roller,
      and rushed down the room to where the engineer was standing by his
      machinery. For a period which could not have been less than a minute,
      Montague stood staring at the horrible sight; and then slowly he saw what
      had been a mist beginning to define itself as the body of a man whirling
      about the shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the machinery moved more slowly yet, and the din in the mill
      subsided, he saw several men raise the ladder again to the shaft and climb
      up. When the revolving had stopped entirely, they proceeded to cut the
      body loose; but Montague did not wait to see that. He was white and sick,
      and he turned and went outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away to another part of the yards and sat down in the shade of one
      of the buildings, and told himself that that was the way of life. All the
      while the din of the mills continued without interruption. A while later
      he saw four men go past, carrying a stretcher covered with a sheet. It
      dropped blood at every step, but Montague noticed that the men who passed
      it gave it no more than a casual glance. When he passed the plate-mill
      again, he saw that it was busy as ever; and when he went out at the front
      gate, he saw a man who had been pointed out to him as the foreman of the
      mill, engaged in picking another labourer from the group which was
      standing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the president's office, and found that Mr. Andrews had just
      arrived. A breeze was blowing through the office, but Andrews, who was
      stout, was sitting in his chair with his coat and vest off, vigorously
      wielding a palmleaf fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Montague?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you ever know such heat? Sit
      down&mdash;you look done up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just seen an accident in the mills,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Too bad. But one finds that steel can't be made
      without accidents. We had a blast-furnace explosion the other day, and
      killed eight. They are mostly foreigners, though&mdash;'hunkies,' they
      call them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Andrews pressed a button, summoning his secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please bring those plans?&rdquo; he said; and to Montague's surprise
      he proceeded to spread before him a complete copy of the old reports of
      the Northern Mississippi survey, together with the surveyor's original
      drawings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Carter let you have them?&rdquo; Montague asked; and the other smiled a
      dry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And now the thing for you to do is to have your
      own surveyors go over the ground. I imagine that when you get their
      reports, the proposition will look very different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were the instructions which came in a letter from Price the next
      day; and with the help of Andrews Montague made the necessary
      arrangements, and the next night he left for New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived upon a Friday afternoon. He found that Alice had departed for
      her visit to the Prentices', and that Oliver was in Newport, also. There
      was an invitation from Mrs. Prentice to him to join them; as Price was
      away, he concluded that he would treat himself to a rest, and accordingly
      took an early train on Saturday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague's initiation into Society had taken place in the winter-time, and
      he had yet to witness its vacation activities. When Society's belles and
      dames had completed a season's round of dinner-parties and dances, they
      were more or less near to nervous prostration, and Newport was the place
      which they had selected to retire to and recuperate. It was an
      old-fashioned New England town, not far from the entrance to Long Island
      Sound, and from a village with several grocery shops and a tavern, it had
      been converted by a magic touch of Society into the most famous and
      expensive resort in the world. Estates had been sold there for as much as
      a dollar a square foot, and it was nothing uncommon to pay ten thousand a
      month for a &ldquo;cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tradition of vacation and of the country was preserved in such terms
      as &ldquo;cottage.&rdquo; You would be invited to a &ldquo;lawn-party,&rdquo; and you would find a
      blaze of illumination, and potted plants enough to fill a score of
      green-houses, and costumes and jewelled splendour suggesting the Field of
      the Cloth of Gold. You would be invited to a &ldquo;picnic&rdquo; at Gooseberry Point,
      and when you went there, you would find gorgeous canopies spread overhead,
      and velvet carpets under foot, and scores of liveried lackeys in
      attendance, and every luxury one would have expected in a Fifth Avenue
      mansion. You would take a cab to drive to this &ldquo;picnic,&rdquo; and it would cost
      you five dollars; yet you must on no account go without a cab. Even if the
      destination was just around the corner, a stranger would commit a breach
      of the proprieties if he were to approach the house on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to Newport as Montague did, directly from the Mississippi Steel
      Mills, produced the strangest possible effect upon him. He had seen the
      social splurge in the Metropolis, and had heard the fabulous prices that
      people had paid for things. But these thousands and millions had seemed
      mere abstractions. Now suddenly they had become personified&mdash;he had
      seen where they came from, where all the luxury and splendour were
      produced! And with every glance that he cast at the magnificence about
      him, he thought of the men who were toiling in the blinding heat of the
      blast-furnaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the palace of the Wymans, upon the laying out of the grounds of
      which a half million dollars had been spent; the stone wall which
      surrounded it was famous upon two continents, because it had cost a
      hundred thousand dollars. And it was to make steel rails for the Wymans
      that the slaves of the mills were toiling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the palace of the Eldridge Devons, with a greenhouse which had
      cost one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and which merely supplied the
      daily needs of its owners. Here was the famous tulip tree, which had been
      dug up and brought a distance of fifty miles, at a cost of a thousand
      dollars. And Montague had seen in the making the steel for one of the
      great hotels of the Eldridge Devons!
    </p>
    <p>
      And here was the Walling establishment, the &ldquo;three-million-dollar palace
      on a desert,&rdquo; as Mrs. Billy Alden had described it. Montague had read of
      the famous mantel in its entrance hall, made from Pompeiian marble, and
      costing seventy-five thousand dollars. And the Wallings were the railroad
      kings who transported Mississippi Steel!
    </p>
    <p>
      And from that his thoughts roamed on to the slaves of other mills, to the
      men and women and little children shut up to toil in shops and factories
      and mines for these people who flaunted their luxury about him. They had
      come here from every part of the country, with their millions drawn from
      every kind of labour. Here was the great white marble palace of the
      Johnsons&mdash;the ceilings, floors, and walls of its state apartments had
      all been made in France; its fences and gates, even its locks and hinges,
      had been made from special designs by famous artists. The Johnsons were
      lords of railroads and coal, and ruled the state of West Virginia with a
      terrible hand. The courts and the legislature were but branches of old
      Johnson's office, and Montague knew of mining villages which were owned
      outright by the Company, and were like stockaded forts; the wretched
      toilers could not buy so much as a pint of milk outside of the Company
      store, and even the country doctor could not enter the gates without a
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And beyond that was the home of the Warfields, whose fortune came from
      great department stores, in which young girls worked for two dollars and a
      half a week, and eked out their existence by prostitution. And this was
      the summer that Warfield's youngest daughter was launched, and for her
      debutante dance they built a ballroom which cost thirty thousand dollars&mdash;and
      was torn down the day afterwards!
    </p>
    <p>
      And beyond this, upon the cliffs, was the castle of the Mayers, whose
      fortunes came from coal.&mdash;Montague thought of the young man who had
      invented the device for the automatic weighing of coal as it was loaded
      upon steam-ships. Major Venable had hinted to him that the reason the Coal
      Trust would not consider it, was because they were selling short weight;
      and since then he had investigated the story, and learned that this was
      true, and that it was old Mayer himself who had devised the system. And
      here was his palace, and here were his sons and daughters&mdash;among the
      most haughty and exclusive of Society's entertainers!
    </p>
    <p>
      So you might drive down the streets and point out the mansions and call
      the roll of the owners&mdash;kings of oil and steel and railroads and
      mines! Here everything was beauty and splendour. Here were velvet lawns
      and gardens of rare flowers, and dancing and feasting and merriment. It
      seemed very far from the sordid strife of commerce, from poverty and toil
      and death. But Montague carried with him the sight that he had seen in the
      plate-mill, the misty blur about the whirling shaft, and the shrouded form
      upon the stretcher, dripping blood.
    </p>
    <h3>
      * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      He was so fortunate as to meet Alice and her friends upon the street, and
      he drove with them to the bathing beach which Society had purchased and
      maintained for its own exclusive use. The first person he saw here was
      Reggie Mann, who came and took possession of Alice. Reggie would not swim
      himself, because he did not care to exhibit his spindle legs; he was
      watching with disapproving eye the antics of Harry Percy, his dearest
      rival. Percy was a man about forty years of age, a cotillion-leader by
      profession; and he caused keen delight to the spectators upon the beach by
      wearing a monocle in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had lunch at the Casino, and then went for a sail in the Prentices'
      new racing yacht. It was estimated just at this time that there was thirty
      millions' worth of steam and sailing pleasure-craft in Newport harbour,
      and the bay was a wonderful sight that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came back rather early, however, as Alice had an engagement for a
      drive at six o'clock, and it was necessary for her to change her costume
      before she went. It was necessary to change it again before dinner, which
      was at eight o'clock; and Montague learned upon inquiry that it was
      customary to make five or six such changes during the day. The great
      ladies of Society were adepts in this art, and prided themselves upon the
      perfect system which enabled them to accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Montague's New York acquaintances were here in their splendour:
      Miss Yvette Simpkins, with her forty trunks of new Paris costumes; Mrs.
      Billy Alden, who had just launched an aristocratic and exclusive
      bridge-club for ladies; Mrs. Winnie Duval, who had created a sensation by
      the rumour of her intention to introduce the simple life at Newport; and
      Mrs. Vivie Patton, whose husband had committed suicide as the only means
      of separating her from her Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced to be the evening of Mrs. Landis's long-expected dinner-dance.
      When you went to the Landis mansion, you drove directly into the building,
      which had a court so large that a coach and four could drive around it.
      The entire ground floor was occupied by what were said to be the most
      elaborately equipped stables in the world. Your horses vanished magically
      through sliding doors at one side, and your carriage at the other side,
      and in front of you was the entrance to the private apartments, with
      liveried flunkies standing in state.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were five tables at this dinner, each seating ten persons. There was
      a huge floral umbrella for the centrepiece, and an elaborate colour effect
      in flowers. During the dance, screens were put up concealing this end of
      the ballroom, and when they were removed sometime after midnight, the
      tables were found set for the supper, with an entirely new scenic effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      They danced until broad daylight; Montague was told of parties at which
      the guests had adjourned in the morning to play tennis. All these people
      would be up by nine or ten o'clock the next day, and he would see them in
      the shops and at the bathing beach before noon. And this was Society's
      idea of &ldquo;resting&rdquo; from the labours of the winter season!
    </p>
    <p>
      After the supper Montague was taken in charge by Mrs. Caroline Smythe, the
      lady who had once introduced him to her cats and dogs. Mrs. Smythe had
      become greatly interested in Mrs. Winnie's anti-vivisection crusade, and
      told him all about it while they strolled out upon the loggia of the
      Landis palace, and stood and watched the sunrise over the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that road back of us?&rdquo; said Mrs. Smythe. &ldquo;That is the one the
      Landises have just succeeded in closing. I suppose you've heard the
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;I haven't heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the joke of Newport,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;They had to buy up the town
      council to do it. There was a sight-seers' bus that used to drive up that
      road every day, and the driver would rein up his horses and stand up and
      point with his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This, ladies and gentlemen,' he'd say, 'is the home of the Landises, and
      just beyond there is the home of the Joneses. Once upon a time Mr. Smith
      had a wife and got tired of her, and Mr. Jones had a wife and got tired of
      her; so they both got divorces and exchanged, and now Mrs. Smith is living
      in Mr. Jones's house, and Mrs. Jones is living in Mr. Smith's. Giddap!'&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alice was up early the next morning to go to church with Harry Curtiss,
      but Montague, who had really come to rest, was later in arising.
      Afterwards he took a stroll through the streets, watching the people. He
      was met by Mrs. De Graffenried, who, after her usual fashion, invited him
      to come round to lunch. He went, and met about forty other persons who had
      been invited in the same casual way, including his brother Ollie&mdash;and
      to his great consternation, Ollie's friend, Mr. Gamble!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gamble was clad in a spotless yachting costume, which produced a most
      comical effect upon his expansive person. He greeted Montague with his
      usual effusiveness. &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Montague&mdash;how do you do?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I've been hearing about you since I met you last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that you have gone with the Mississippi Steel Company,&rdquo; said
      Gamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a fashion,&rdquo; the other assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to be careful&mdash;you are dealing with a smooth crowd!
      Smoother even than the men in the Trust, I fancy.&rdquo; And the little man
      added, with a twinkle in his eye: &ldquo;I'm accustomed to say there are two
      kinds of rascals in the oil business; there are the rascals who found they
      could rely upon each other, and they are in the Trust; and there are the
      rascals the devil himself couldn't rely upon, and they're the
      independents. I ought to know what I'm talking about, because I was an
      independent myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gamble chuckled gleefully over this witticism, which was evidently one
      which he relied upon for the making of conversation. &ldquo;How do you do,
      Captain?&rdquo; he said, to a man who was passing. &ldquo;Mr. Montague, let me
      introduce my friend Captain Gill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague turned and faced a tall and dignified-looking naval officer.
      &ldquo;Captain Henry Gill, of the Allegheny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you, Mr. Montague?&rdquo; said the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Montague's brother,&rdquo; added Gamble, by way of further introduction.
      And then, espying someone else coming whom he knew, he waddled off down
      the room, leaving Montague in conversation with the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gill was in command of one of the half-dozen vessels which the
      government obligingly sent to assist in maintaining the gaieties of the
      Newport season. He was an excellent dancer, and a favourite with the
      ladies, and an old crony of Mrs. De Graffenried's. &ldquo;Have you known Mr.
      Gamble long?&rdquo; he asked, by way of making conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him once before,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;My brother knows him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ollie seems to be a great favourite of his,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Queer
      chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague assented readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him in Brooklyn,&rdquo; continued the other, seeming to feel that
      acquaintance with Gamble called for explanation. &ldquo;He was quite chummy with
      the officers at the Navy Yard. Retired millionaires don't often fall in
      their way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should imagine not,&rdquo; said Montague, smiling. &ldquo;But I was surprised to
      meet him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd meet him in heaven,&rdquo; said the other, with a laugh, &ldquo;if he made up
      his mind that he wanted to go there. He is a good-natured personage; but I
      can tell you that anyone who thinks that Gamble doesn't know what he's
      about will make a sad mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague thought of this remark at lunch, where he sat at table on the
      opposite side to Gamble. Next to him sat Vivie Fatten, who made the little
      man the victim of her raillery. It was not particularly delicate wit, but
      Gamble was tough, and took it all with a cheerful grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a mystery which Montague could not solve. To be sure he was rich,
      and spent his money like water; but then there was no scarcity of money in
      this crowd. Montague found himself wondering whether he was there because
      Mrs. De Graffenried and her friends liked to have somebody they could snub
      and wipe their feet upon. His eye ran down the row of people sitting at
      the table, and the contrast between them and Gamble was an amusing one.
      Mrs. De Graffenried was fond of the society of young people, and most of
      her guests were of the second or even the third generation. The man from
      Pittsburg seemed to be the only one there who had made his own money, and
      who bore the impress of the money struggle upon him. Montague smiled at
      the thought. He seemed the very incarnation of the spirit of oil; he was
      gross and unpleasant, while in the others the oil had been refined to a
      delicate perfume. Yet somehow he seemed the most human person there. No
      doubt he was crudely egotistical; and yet, if he was interested in
      himself, he was also interested in other people, while among Mrs. De
      Graffenried's intimates it was a sign of vulgarity to be interested in
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have taken quite a fancy to Montague, for reasons best known
      to himself. He came up to him again, after the luncheon. &ldquo;This is the
      first time you've been here, Oliver tells me,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague assented, and the other added: &ldquo;You'd better come and let me show
      you the town. I have my car here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague had no engagement, and no excuse handy. &ldquo;It's very good of you&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Gamble. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he took him out and seated him in his huge red touring-car, which had
      a seat expressly built for its owner, not too deep, and very low, so that
      his fat little legs would reach the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gamble settled back in the cushions with a sigh. &ldquo;Rum sort of a place
      this, ain't it?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's interesting for a short visit,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can count me out of it,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I like to spend my summers
      in a place where I can take my coat off. And I prefer beer to champagne in
      hot weather, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an ungodly lot of snobs a fellow does meet!&rdquo; remarked his host,
      cheerily. &ldquo;They have a fine time making fun of me&mdash;it amuses them,
      and I don't mind. Sometimes it does make you mad, though; you feel you'd
      like to make them swallow you, anyway. But then you think, What's the use
      of going after something you don't want, just because other people say you
      can't have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on Montague's lips to ask, &ldquo;Then why do you come here?&rdquo; But he
      forbore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car sped on down the stately driveway, and his companion proceeded to
      point out the mansions and the people, and to discuss them in his own
      peculiar style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that yellow brick house in there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That belongs to Allis,
      the railroad man. He used to live in Pittsburg, and I remember him thirty
      years ago, when he had one carriage for his three babies, and pushed them
      himself, by thunder. He was glad to borrow money from me then, but now he
      looks the other way when I go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allis used to be in the steel business six or eight years ago,&rdquo; Gamble
      continued, reminiscently. &ldquo;Then he sold out&mdash;it was the real
      beginning of the forming of the Steel Trust. Did you ever hear that
      story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;if you are going to match yourself against the
      Steel crowd, it's a good idea to know about them. Did you ever meet Jim
      Stagg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wall Street plunger?&rdquo; asked Montague. &ldquo;He's a mere name to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His last exploit was to pull off a prize fight in one of the swell hotels
      in New York, and one nigger punched the other through a plate-glass
      mirror. Stagg comes from the wild West, you know, and he's wild as they
      make 'em&mdash;my God, I could tell you some stories about him that'd make
      your hair stand up! Perhaps you remember some time ago he raided Tennessee
      Southern in the market and captured it; and old Waterman testified that he
      took it away from him because he didn't consider he was a fit man to own
      it. As a matter of fact, that was just pure bluff, for Waterman uses him
      in little jobs like that all the time.&mdash;Well, six or eight years ago,
      Stagg owned a big steel plant out West; and there was a mill in Indiana,
      belonging to Allis, that interfered with their business. One time Stagg
      and some of his crowd had been on a spree for several days, and late one
      night they got to talking about Allis. 'Let's buy the&mdash;&mdash;out,'
      said Stagg, so they ordered a special and a load of champagne, and away
      they went to the city in Indiana. They got to Allis's house about four
      o'clock in the morning, and they rang the bell and banged on the door, and
      after a while the butler came, half awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is Allis in?' asked Stagg, and before the fellow could answer, the whole
      crowd pushed into the hall, and Stagg stood at the foot of the stairs and
      roared&mdash;he's got a voice like a bull, you know&mdash;'Allis, Allis,
      come down here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allis came to the head of the stairs in his nightshirt, half frightened
      to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Allis, we want to buy your steel plant,' said Stagg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Buy my steel plant!' gasped Allis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sure, buy it outright! Spot cash! We'll pay you five hundred thousand
      for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But it cost me over twelve hundred thousand,' said Allis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, then, we'll pay you twelve hundred thousand,' said Stagg&mdash;'God
      damn you, we'll pay you fifteen hundred thousand!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My plant isn't for sale,' said Allis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We'll pay you two million!' shouted Stagg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It isn't for sale, I tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We'll pay you two million and a half! Come on down here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do you mean that?' gasped Allis. He could hardly credit his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come downstairs and I'll write you a check!' said Stagg. And so they
      hauled him down, and they bought his mill. Then they opened some more
      champagne, and Allis began to get good-natured, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There's only one thing the matter with my mill,' said he, 'and that's
      Jones's mill over in Harristown. The railroads give him rebates, and he
      undersells me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, damn his soul,' said Stagg, 'we'll have his mill, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so they bundled into their special again, and about six o'clock in
      the morning they got to Harristown, and they bought another mill. And that
      started them, you know. They'd never had such fun in their lives before.
      It seems that Stagg had just cleaned up ten or twelve millions on a big
      Wall Street plunge, and they blew in every dollar, buying steel mills&mdash;and
      paying two or three prices for every one, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamble paused and chuckled to himself. &ldquo;What I'm telling you is the story
      that Stagg told me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And of course you've got to make
      allowances. He said he had no idea of what Dan Waterman had been planning,
      but I fancy that was a lie. Harrison of Pittsburg had been threatening to
      build a railroad of his own, and take away his business from Waterman's
      roads, and so there was nothing for Waterman to do but buy him out at
      three times what his mills were worth. He took the mills that Stagg had
      bought at the same time. Stagg had paid two or three prices, and Waterman
      paid him a couple of prices more, and then he passed them on to the
      American people for a couple of prices more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamble paused. &ldquo;That's where they get these fortunes,&rdquo; he added, waving
      his fat little hand. &ldquo;Sometimes it makes a fellow laugh to think of it.
      Every concern they bought was overcapitalised to begin with; I doubt if
      two hundred million dollars' worth of honest dollars was ever put into the
      Steel Trust properties, and they capitalised it at a billion, and now
      they've raised it to a billion and a half! The men who pulled it off made
      hundreds of millions, and the poor public that bought the common stock saw
      it go down to six! They gave old Harrison a four-hundred-million-dollar
      mortgage on the property, and he sits back and grins, and wonders why a
      man can't die poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamble's car was opposite one of the clubs. Suddenly he signalled his
      chauffeur to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Billy!&rdquo; he called; and a young naval officer who was walking down
      the steps turned and came toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing with yourself?&rdquo; said Gamble. &ldquo;Mr. Montague, my
      friend Lieutenant Long, of the Engineers. Where are you going, Billy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere in particular,&rdquo; said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; said Gamble, pointing to the vacant seat between them. &ldquo;I am
      showing Mr. Montague the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other climbed in, and they went on. &ldquo;The Lieutenant has just come up
      from Brooklyn,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Lively times we had in Brooklyn, didn't we,
      Billy? Tell me what you have been doing lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm working hard,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant&mdash;&ldquo;studying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Studying here in Newport?&rdquo; laughed Gamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's easy enough when you belong to the Engineers,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;We
      are working-men, and they don't want us at their balls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Gamble,&rdquo; he added, after a moment, &ldquo;I was looking for you. I
      want you to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Gamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I have just had notice from the Department that I
      am one of a board of five that has been appointed to draw up
      specifications for machine oil for the Navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do about it?&rdquo; asked Gamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to help me draw them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't know anything about machine oil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot possibly know less than I do,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant. &ldquo;Surely,
      if you have been in the oil business, you can give me some sort of an idea
      about machine oil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamble thought for a minute. &ldquo;I might try,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But would it be the
      proper thing for me to do? Of course, I'm out of the business myself; but
      I have friends who might bid for the contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your friends can take their chances with the rest,&rdquo; said the
      Lieutenant. &ldquo;I am a friend, too, hang it. And how in the world am I to
      find out anything about oil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamble was silent again. &ldquo;Well, I'll do what I can for you,&rdquo; he said,
      finally. &ldquo;I'll write out what I know about the qualities of good oil, and
      you can use it as you think best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant, with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll have to agree to say nothing about it,&rdquo; said Gamble. &ldquo;It's a
      delicate matter, you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may trust me for that,&rdquo; said the other, laughing. So the subject was
      dropped, and they went on with their ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Gamble set Montague down, at General Prentice's door,
      and he bade them farewell and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General was coming down the stairs. &ldquo;Hello, Allan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where
      have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing the place a little,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the drawing-room,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;There's a man in there
      you ought to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the brainiest newspaper men in Wall Street,&rdquo; he added, as he went
      across the hall,&mdash;&ldquo;the financial man of the Express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague entered the room and was introduced to a powerfully built and
      rather handsome young fellow, who had not so long ago been centre-rush
      upon a famous football team. &ldquo;Well, Bates,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;what are
      you after now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm trying to get the inside story of the failure of Grant and Ward,&rdquo;
       said Bates. &ldquo;I supposed you'd know about it, if anyone did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know about it,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;but the circumstances are such that
      I'm not free to tell&mdash;at least, not for publication. I'll tell you
      privately, if you want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bates, &ldquo;I'd rather you didn't do that; I can find it out
      somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come all the way to Newport to see me?&rdquo; asked the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not entirely,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;I'm to get an interview with Wyman
      about the new bond issue of his road. What do you think of the market,
      General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things look bad to me,&rdquo; said Prentice. &ldquo;It's a good time to reef sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Bates turned to Montague. &ldquo;I think I passed you a while ago in the
      street,&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;You were with James Gamble, weren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bates knows everybody,&rdquo; put in the General; &ldquo;that's his specialty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to know Gamble particularly well,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;I have a brother
      in his office in Pittsburg. What in the world do you suppose he is doing
      in Newport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just seeing the world, so he told me,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;He has nothing to
      do since his company sold out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold out!&rdquo; echoed Bates. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the Trust has bought him out,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other stared at him. &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me so himself,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;Then it's just some dodge that he's up to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he hasn't sold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it, I know it,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;At any rate, he hadn't sold
      three days ago. I had a letter from my brother saying that they were
      expecting to land a big oil contract with the government that would put
      them on Easy Street for the next five years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said no more. But he did some thinking. Experience had sharpened
      his wits, and by this time he knew a clew when he met it. A while later,
      when Bates had gone and his brother had come in with Alice, he got Oliver
      off in a corner and demanded, &ldquo;How much are you to get out of that oil
      contract?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other stared at him in consternation. &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;Did he tell you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me some things,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;and I guessed the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was watching him anxiously. &ldquo;See here, Allan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you'll
      keep quiet about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine I will,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It's none of my business, that I can
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly Oliver broke into a smile of amusement. &ldquo;Say, Allan!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;He's a clever dog, isn't he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very clever,&rdquo; admitted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been after that thing for six months, you know&mdash;and just as
      smooth and quiet! It's about the slickest game I ever heard of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could he know what officers were to make out those
      specifications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's easy,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;That was the beginning of the whole
      thing. They got a tip that the contract was to be let, and they had no
      trouble in finding out the names of the officers. That kind of thing is
      common, you know; the bureaus in Washington are rotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gamble's company is in a bad way,&rdquo; Oliver continued. &ldquo;The Trust just
      about had it in a corner. But Gamble saw this chance, and he staked
      everything on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's his idea?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;What good will it do him to write
      the specifications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are five officers,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;and he's been laying siege to
      every one of them. So now they are all his intimate friends, and every one
      of them has come to him for help! So there will go into Washington five
      sets of specifications, all different, but each containing one essential
      point. You see, Gamble's company has a peculiar kind of oil; it contains
      some ingredient or other&mdash;he told me the name, but I don't remember
      it now. It doesn't make it any better oil, and it doesn't make it any
      worse; but it's different from any other oil in the world. And now, don't
      you see&mdash;whatever other requirements are specified, this one quality
      will surely appear; and there will be only one company in the world that
      can bid. Of course they will name their own figure, and get a five-year
      contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague, drily. &ldquo;It's a beautiful scheme. And how much do
      you get out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He paid me ten thousand at the start,&rdquo; said Oliver; &ldquo;and I am to get five
      per cent of the first year's contract, whatever that may be. Gamble says
      his bid won't be less than half a million, so you see it was worth while!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Oliver chuckled to himself. &ldquo;He's going home to-morrow,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;So
      my job is done. I'll probably never see him again&mdash;until his four
      prize daughters get ready for the market!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montague returned to New York and plunged into his work. The election at
      which he was scheduled to become president of the Northern Mississippi was
      not to come off for a month. Meantime there was no lack of work for him to
      do. It would, of course, be necessary for him to return to Mississippi to
      live, and he had to close up his affairs in New York. Also he wished to
      fit himself for the work of superintending a railroad. Through the
      courtesy of General Prentice, he was introduced to the president of one of
      the great transcontinental lines, and made a study of that official's
      office system. He went South again to inspect the work of the surveyors,
      and to consult with the engineers who had been selected for the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Price went ahead with his arrangements to take over the control of the
      road, without paying any attention to the old management. He sent for
      Montague one day, and introduced him to a Mr. Haskins, who was to be
      elected vice-president of the road. Haskins, he said, had formerly been
      general manager of the Tennessee Southern, and was a practical railroad
      man. Montague was to rely upon him for all the details of his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haskins was a wiry, nervous little man, with a bad temper and a sarcastic
      tongue; he worshipped the gospel of efficiency, and in the consultations
      with him Montague got many curious lights upon the management of
      railroads. He learned, for instance, that a conspicuous item in the
      construction account was the money to be used in paying local government
      boards for right of way through towns and villages. Apparently no one even
      considered the possibility of securing the privilege by any other methods.
      Montague did not like the prospect, but he said nothing. Then again, the
      road was to purchase its rails and other necessaries from the Mississippi
      Steel Company, and apparently it was expected to pay a fancy price for
      these; it was not to ask for any of the discounts which were customary.
      Also Montague was troubled to learn that the secretary and treasurer of
      the road were to receive liberal salaries, and that no questions were to
      be asked, because they were relatives of Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that he put up with; but matters came to a head about ten days before
      the election, when one day Haskins came to his office with the engineers'
      estimates, and with his own figures of the probable cost of the extension.
      Most of the figures were much higher than those which Montague had worked
      out for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to do better on those contracts,&rdquo; he said, pointing to some of
      the items.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say we might,&rdquo; said Haskins; &ldquo;but those contracts are to go to the
      Hill Manufacturing Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;I thought that we were to
      advertise for bids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Haskins, &ldquo;but that company is to get the contracts, all the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; asked Montague, &ldquo;that we are not to give them to the lowest
      bidder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid not,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Price said anything to you to that effect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't understand,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;what is this Hill Manufacturing
      Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Haskins smiled. &ldquo;It's a concern that Price has organised himself,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague stared in amazement. &ldquo;Price himself!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His nephew is president of the company,&rdquo; added the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a new company?&rdquo; Montague asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Organised especially for the purpose,&rdquo; smiled the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does it manufacture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't manufacture anything; it simply sells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;it's a device whereby Mr. Price proposes
      to rob the stockholders of the Northern Mississippi Railroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can phrase it that way if you choose,&rdquo; said Haskins, quietly; &ldquo;but I
      wouldn't advise you to let Price hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; responded Montague, and brought the interview to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a day to think the matter over. It was not his habit to act upon
      impulse. He saw that the time had come for him to speak, but he wished to
      be sure of his course of action before he began. He had dinner at the Club
      that evening, and, seeing his friend Major Venable ensconced in a big
      leather chair in the reading-room, he went and sat down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Major?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've got another case that I want to ask
      you some questions about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always at your service,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has to do with a railroad,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Did you ever hear of such
      a thing as a railroad president organising a company to sell supplies to
      his own road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major smiled grimly. &ldquo;Yes, I have heard of it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it common?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so common as you might suppose,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;A railroad
      president is commonly not an important enough man to be permitted to do
      it. If it happens to be a big road, and the president is a power in it,
      why, then he may do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Higgins's trick,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Higgins used to go around
      making speeches to Sunday schools; he was the kind of man that the
      newspapers like to refer to as a model citizen and a leader of enterprise.
      His brothers, and his brothers-in-law, and his cousins, and all his family
      went into business in order to sell things to his railroads. I heard of
      one story&mdash;it has never come out, but it's very amusing. Every year
      the road would advertise its contract for stationery. It used about a
      million dollars' worth, and there'd be long and most elaborate
      specifications published&mdash;columns and columns. But sandwiched away
      somewhere in the middle of a paragraph was the provision that the paper
      must all bear a certain watermark; and that watermark was patented by one
      of Higgins's companies! It didn't even own so much as a mill&mdash;it
      sublet all the contracts. When Higgins died, he left eighty million
      dollars; but they juggled the records, and you read in all the newspapers
      that he left 'a few millions.' That was in Philadelphia, where you can do
      such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague sat thinking for a few moments. &ldquo;But I can't see why they should
      do it in this case,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The men who are doing it own nearly all of
      the stock of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does that make?&rdquo; asked the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they are simply plundering their own property,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;What do they care about the value of the property?
      They'll unload it before the public finds out; and in the meantime they
      are probably manipulating the stock. That's the scheme they're working
      with the street railroads over in Brooklyn, for instance; the more
      irregular the dividends are, the more violently the stock fluctuates, and
      the better they like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is the case of a railroad that is being built,&rdquo; said Montague;
      &ldquo;and they are putting up the money to build it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;of course; and then they are paying it back to
      themselves by this dodge; and they'll still have the stock, and whatever
      they can get for it will be profit. And if the State Legislature comes
      along and asks any impertinent questions, they can open their books and
      say: 'See, we have spent this much for improvements. This is the cost of
      the road; and if you reduce our freight-rates, you will cut off our
      dividends and confiscate our property.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Major gazed at Montague with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;another thing. You say they are putting up the money.
      Are you sure it's their own money? Commonly the greater part of the cost
      of railroad building is paid by bonds, and they work those bonds off on
      banks and insurance companies and trust companies. Have you thought of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hadn't,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know very few men in Wall Street who use their own money,&rdquo; the Major
      added. &ldquo;Take the case of Wyman, for instance. Wyman's railroad keeps a
      cash surplus of twenty or thirty millions, and Wyman uses that in Wall
      Street. And when he has made his profit, he takes it and salts it away in
      village improvement bonds all over the country. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;It's a bad game for the small stockholder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a bad game for the small man of any sort,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;When I
      was young, I can remember, a man would save a little money and put it into
      an enterprise of some sort, and whatever the profits were, he would get
      his share of them. But now, you see, the big men have got control, and
      they are greedier than they used to be. There is nothing hurts them so
      much as to see the little fellow get any share of the profits, and they've
      all sorts of schemes for doing him out of it. I could take a week off and
      tell you about them. You are manufacturing soap, we will say. You find
      there are too many soap manufacturers and too much soap, and so you
      propose to combine, and put your rivals out of business, and monopolise
      the soap market. Your properties are already capitalised at twice what
      they cost you, because you are naturally hopeful, and that is what you
      expected they would earn; but now for this new combination you issue stock
      to the amount of three times this imagined value. Then you fill the street
      with rumours of the wonders of your soap combination, and all the
      privileges and monopolies that you've got, and you unload your stock on
      the public, we'll say at eighty. You may have sold all your stock, but
      you've still got control of the corporation. The public is helpless and
      unorganised, and your men are in. Then the Street begins to hear
      disturbing rumours about the soap trust, and your board of directors meet
      and declare that it is impossible to pay any dividends. There is great
      indignation among the stockholders, and an opposition is organised, but
      you set the clock an hour ahead, and elect your ticket before the other
      fellow comes around. Or perhaps the troubles have already knocked the
      stock down sufficiently low to satisfy you, and you buy a majority of it
      back. Then the public hears that a new interest has purchased the soap
      trust, and that a new and honest administration is to be elected; and once
      more there is hope for soap. You buy a few more plants, and issue more
      stocks and bonds, and soap begins to boom, and you sell once more. You can
      work that regularly every two or three years, for there is always a new
      crop of investors, and nobody but a few people in Wall Street can possibly
      keep track of what you are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major paused for a while, and sat with a happy smile on his
      countenance. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are floods and floods of wealth,
      pouring into Wall Street from all over the country. It comes to me like a
      vision. The crops are growing, the mines and the mills and the factories
      are working, and here is all the money. People don't like to take it and
      hide it up their chimneys&mdash;few people have chimneys nowadays. They
      want to invest it; and so you prepare investments for them. Take the
      street railroads here in New York, for instance. What could be a safer
      investment than the street railroads of the Metropolis? An absolute
      monopoly, and traffic growing so fast that construction can't keep up with
      it. Profits are sure. So people buy street railway stocks and bonds. In
      this case it's the politicians who organise the construction companies;
      that's their share, in return for the franchises. The insiders have a new
      scheme&mdash;the best yet; it's like a Gatling gun against bows and
      arrows. They organise a syndicate, and get the franchises for nothing, and
      then sell them to the company for millions. They've even sold franchises
      they didn't own, and railroad lines that hadn't been built. You'll find
      some improvements charged for four or five times over, and the
      improvements haven't yet been made. First and last they have paid
      themselves about thirty million dollars. And, in the meantime, the poor
      stockholder wonders why he doesn't get his dividends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the investment market,&rdquo; the Major continued after a pause; &ldquo;but of
      course the biggest reservoirs of wealth are the insurance companies and
      the banks. It's there the real fortunes are made; you'll find you lose the
      greater part of your profits, unless you've got your own banks to take
      your bonds. I heard an amusing story the other day of a man who was
      manufacturing electrical supplies. He prides himself on being an honest
      business man, and having nothing to do with Wall Street. His company
      wanted to extend its business, and it issued a couple of hundred thousand
      dollars' worth of bonds, and went to the Fidelity Insurance Company and
      offered them at ninety. 'We aren't buying any bonds just at present,' said
      they, 'but suppose you try the National Trust Company.' So the man went
      there, and they offered him eighty for the bonds. That was the best he
      could do, and in the end he had to take it. And then the trust company
      turns the bonds over to the insurance company at par. I could name you
      half a dozen trust companies in New York that are simply syndicates of
      insurance people for the working of that little game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major paused. &ldquo;You see it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; Montague replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a trust company by any chance back of this railroad you are
      talking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; said Montague; and the Major shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By and by they will find their first bond
      issue inadequate to meet the cost of the proposed improvements. The
      estimates of the engineers will be found too low, and there will be
      another issue of bonds, and your president's company will get another
      contract. And then the first thing you know, your president will organise
      a manufacturing enterprise along the line of his road, and the road will
      give him secret rebates, and practically carry his goods free; or else
      he'll organise a private-car line, and make the road pay for the privilege
      of hauling his cars. Or perhaps he's already got some industrial concern,
      and is simply building the road as a side issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major stopped. He saw that Montague was staring at him with an
      expression of perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, Major!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;Do you know what road I've
      been talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Major sank back in his chair and went into a fit of laughter. He
      laughed until he was purple in the face, and he could hardly find breath
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really thought you did!&rdquo; Montague protested. &ldquo;It's exactly the
      situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo; said the Major, fishing for his pocket handkerchief to wipe
      the tears from his eyes. &ldquo;Dear me! It makes me think of our district
      attorney's lemon story. Did you ever hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was one of the bright spots in a dreary reform campaign that we had a
      few years ago. It seems that our young crusader was giving his audience a
      few illustrations of how dishonest officials could make money in this
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Let us imagine a case,' he said. 'You are an inspector of fruit, and
      there is a scarcity of lemons in New York. There are two ships full of
      lemons on the way, and one ship gets in twenty-four hours ahead. Now the
      law requires that the fruit be carefully inspected. If you are too careful
      about it, it will take more than twenty-four hours, and the owner of the
      cargo will lose a small fortune. So he comes to you and offers you a
      thousand or two, and you don't stop to open every crate of his lemons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The district attorney told that story at a meeting, and the next morning
      the newspapers published it. That afternoon he happened to meet a fruit
      inspector, who was an old friend of his. 'Say, old man,' said the
      inspector, 'who the devil told you about those lemons?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Montague called at Price's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Price,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a matter has come up in my discussions with Mr.
      Haskins about which I thought it necessary to consult you immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Haskins informs me that it is understood that the Hill Manufacturing
      Company is to be favoured in the matter of contracts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was watching Price narrowly, and he saw his jaw set grimly, and a
      hostile look come upon his features. Price had been lounging back in his
      chair; now, slowly, he straightened himself up, as if to receive an
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Haskins correct?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He also stated that you are interested in the company. Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He also stated that the company did not manufacture, but simply sold. Is
      that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Price,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;This is a matter about which we
      must have an understanding without delay. In my preliminary talks with you
      I was informed that it was your wish to find a man who should run the road
      honestly. The situation which you have just outlined to me does not seem
      to me consistent with that programme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was prepared for an angry response, but he saw the other make an
      effort and control himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must realise, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are not very familiar
      with methods in the railroad world. This company of which you speak
      possesses advantages; it can secure better terms&mdash;&rdquo; Price stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that it can purchase goods more cheaply than the railroad itself
      can?&rdquo; demanded Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some cases,&rdquo; began the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;In any case where it can obtain better
      terms, there can be no objection to its receiving the contract. But that
      does not agree with what Mr. Haskins told me; he gave me to understand
      that we were to prepare to pay a much higher price because it would be
      necessary to give the contracts to the Hill Manufacturing Company; and
      that was my reason for coming to see you. I wish to have a distinct
      understanding with you upon this point. While I am president of the
      Northern Mississippi Railroad, everything that is purchased by the road
      will be purchased in fair competition, and the concern which will give us
      the lowest price for the quality of goods we need will receive our order.
      That is a matter about which there must be left no possible room for
      misunderstanding. I trust I have made myself clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made yourself clear,&rdquo; said Price; and so the interview
      terminated.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montague went back to his work, but with a heart full of misgivings. He
      would have liked to persuade himself that that was the end of the episode,
      but he could not do it. He foresaw that his job as president of a railroad
      would not be a sinecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his forebodings, however, he was unprepared for the development
      which came the next day. Young Curtiss called him up, early in the
      morning, and asked him to wait at his office. A few minutes later he came
      in, with evident agitation upon his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montague,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have something important to tell you. I cannot
      leave you in ignorance about it. But before I begin, you must understand
      one thing&mdash;that I am taking my future in my hands by telling you. And
      you must promise me that you will never give the slightest hint that I
      have spoken to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will promise,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not even let on that you know,&rdquo; added the other. &ldquo;Price would
      know that I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's Price!&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I'll promise to protect you. What is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called up Davenant yesterday afternoon, and told him that you were not
      to be elected president of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague gazed at him in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says you are to be dropped entirely,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Haskins is to
      be president. Davenant had to tell me, because I am one of the directors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's it,&rdquo; Montague whispered to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what's the matter?&rdquo; asked Curtiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a long story&mdash;just some graft that I wouldn't stand for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Curtiss, with sudden light. &ldquo;Is it the Hill Manufacturing
      Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Curtiss's turn to stare in amazement. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Do you
      mean that you have thrown up the sponge for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't thrown up the sponge, by any means,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;But
      that's why Price wants to get rid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, man!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;How perfectly absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague fixed his glance upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you advise me to stand for it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow!&rdquo; said Curtiss. &ldquo;I've got some stock in that company
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague sat in silence&mdash;he could think of nothing to say after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world do you suppose you have gone into?&rdquo; protested the
      other. &ldquo;A charity enterprise?&rdquo; Then he stopped, seeing the look of pain
      upon his friend's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put a hand upon his arm. &ldquo;See here, old, man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is too
      bad, honestly. I understand how you feel, and it's a great credit to you;
      but you are living in the world, and you have got to be practical. You
      can't expect to take a railroad and run it as if it were an orphan asylum.
      You can't expect to do business, if you're going to have notions like
      that. It's really a shame, to give up a work like this for such a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague stiffened. &ldquo;I assure you I haven't given up yet,&rdquo; he replied
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo; protested the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to fight,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight?&rdquo; echoed Curtiss. &ldquo;But, man, you are perfectly helpless! Price and
      Ryder own the road, and they will do as they please with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are one of the directors of the road,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;And you know
      the situation. You know the pledges upon which the election of the new
      board was secured. Will you vote for Haskins as president?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, Montague!&rdquo; protested the other. &ldquo;What a thing to ask of me! You
      know perfectly well that I have no power in the road. All the stock I own,
      Price gave me, and what can I do? Why, my whole career would be ruined if
      I were to oppose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;you are a dummy. You are willing to sell
      your name and your character for a block of stock. You take a position of
      trust, and you betray it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other's face hardened. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if that's the way you put
      it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not the way I put it!&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;That is simply the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;don't you realise that they have a majority, even
      without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they have,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;but that is no reason why you should
      not do what is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curtiss arose. &ldquo;There is nothing more to be said,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I am
      sorry you take it that way. I tried to do you a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appreciate that,&rdquo; said Montague, promptly. &ldquo;For that I shall always be
      obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this fight that you propose to make,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you must not
      forget that it is I who have brought you this information&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble about that,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;I will protect you. No one
      shall ever know that I had the information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague spent a half an hour pacing up and down his office in thought.
      Then he called his stenographer, and dictated a letter to his cousin, Mr.
      Lee, and to each of the three other persons whom he had approached in
      relation to their votes at the stockholders' meeting. &ldquo;Certain matters
      have developed,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;in connection with the affairs of the Northern
      Mississippi Railroad, which make me unwilling to accept the position of
      president. It is also my intention to resign from the board of directors
      of the road, in which I find myself powerless to prevent the things of
      which I disapprove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he went on to outline the plan which he intended to carry out,
      explaining that he offered to those whom he had been the means of
      influencing, the opportunity to go in with him upon equal terms. He
      requested them to communicate their decisions by telegraph; and two days
      later he had heard from them all, and was ready for business.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called up Stanley Ryder, and made an appointment for an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a few weeks ago you talked with me in this office,
      and asked me to assist you in electing your ticket for the Northern
      Mississippi Railroad. You said that you wished me to become president of
      the road, and that the reason for the request was that you wanted a man
      whom you could depend upon for efficient and honest management. I accepted
      your offer in good faith; and I have made all arrangements, and put in a
      great deal of hard work at the task of fitting myself for the position.
      Now I have learned from Mr. Price's own lips that he has organised a
      company for the purpose of exploiting the road for his own private
      benefit. I told him that I was unwilling to stand for anything of the
      sort. Since then I have been thinking the matter over, and I have
      concluded that this situation will make it impossible for me to cooperate
      with Mr. Price. I have concluded, therefore, that it would be best for me
      to resign my position as a member of the board of directors, and also to
      withdraw my candidacy as president.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder had avoided Montague's gaze; he sat staring in front of him, and
      tapping nervously with a pencil upon his desk. It was some time before he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he said, finally, &ldquo;I am very sorry indeed to hear your
      decision. But taking all the circumstances into consideration, it seems to
      me that perhaps it is a wise one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must permit me to thank you for what you have done,&rdquo; Ryder added.
      &ldquo;And I trust that this unfortunate episode will not alter our personal
      relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Montague, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had waited to see what Ryder would say. He waited again, having no mind
      to help him in his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say,&rdquo; Ryder repeated, &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;But I trust that you do not
      expect to end our relationship in any such simple way as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw Ryder's expression change. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a matter of grave importance which has to be settled before we
      can part. As you know, I am personally the holder of five hundred shares
      of Northern Mississippi stock; and to that extent I am interested in the
      affairs of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; said Ryder, quietly, &ldquo;but I have nothing to do with
      that. As a stockholder of the road, you look to the board of directors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides being a stockholder myself,&rdquo; continued Montague, without heeding
      this remark, &ldquo;I have also to consider the interests of the three persons
      whom I interviewed in your behalf. I was the means of inducing these
      people to vote for the board which you named. I was the means of inducing
      them to place themselves in the power of Mr. Price and yourself. This
      being the case, I consider that my honour is involved, and that I am
      responsible to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect to do?&rdquo; asked Ryder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written to them, informing them of my intention to withdraw. I
      have not told them the circumstances, but have simply indicated that I
      find myself powerless to prevent certain things to which I object. I have
      told them the course I intend to take, and offered them the opportunity to
      get out upon the same terms as myself. They have accepted the offer, and
      to-morrow I should receive their stock certificates, and their
      authorisation to dispose of them. I have my own certificates here; and I
      have to say that I consider you are under obligation to purchase this
      stock at the same price which you paid for the new stock; namely, fifty
      dollars a share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder stared at him. &ldquo;Mr. Montague, you amaze me!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; said Montague. His voice was hard, and there was a
      grim look upon his face. He fixed his eyes upon Ryder. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;it will be necessary for you to take the stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have to say it,&rdquo; said Ryder, &ldquo;but this seems to me
      impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The total number of shares,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;is thirty-five hundred, and
      the price of them is one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two gazed at each other. Ryder saw the look in Montague's eyes, and he
      did not repeat his sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he inquired, in a low voice, &ldquo;what reason you have to believe
      that I will comply with this extraordinary request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a very good reason, as I believe you will perceive,&rdquo; said
      Montague. &ldquo;You and Mr. Price have purchased this railroad, and you wish to
      plunder it. That is your privilege&mdash;apparently it is the custom here
      in Wall Street to play tricks upon the investing public. But you cannot
      play them upon me, because I know too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I know what you propose to do?&rdquo; asked Ryder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly may,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I propose to fight. Until you have
      purchased my stock and the stock of my friends, I shall remain a director
      in the railroad, and also a candidate for the position of president. I
      shall make a contest at the next directors' meeting, and if I fail in my
      purpose there, I shall carry the fight before the public. I flatter myself
      that my reputation will count for something in my old home; you will not
      be able to carry matters with quite the same high hand in Mississippi as
      you are accustomed to in New York. Also, I shall fight you in the courts.
      I don't happen to know just what is the law in regard to the plundering of
      a public-service corporation by its own directors, but I shall be very
      much surprised if I cannot find some ground upon which to put a stop to
      it. Also, as you know, I am in possession of facts regarding the means
      whereby you got your new privileges from the State Legislature&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder was glaring at him in rage. &ldquo;Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this is
      blackmail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may call it that if you please,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I shall not be
      afraid to face the charge, if you should see fit to bring it in the
      courts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder started to reply, then caught his breath and gasped. When he spoke
      again, he had mastered himself. &ldquo;It seems to me a most extraordinary
      thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Surely, Mr. Montague, you cannot feel at liberty to make
      public what you learned from Mr. Price and myself while you were acting as
      our confidential adviser! Surely you cannot have forgotten the pledge of
      secrecy which you gave me here in this office!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not forgotten it,&rdquo; answered Montague. &ldquo;And I have considered the
      matter with the greatest care. I consider that it is you who have violated
      a pledge. I believe that your violation was a deliberate one&mdash;that
      you had intended it from the very beginning. You assured me that you
      wished an honest administration of the road. I don't believe that you ever
      did wish it; I believe that you had no thought whatever except to use me
      as your tool to secure the control of the railroad, without buying out the
      remaining stockholders. Having accomplished that purpose, you are
      perfectly willing to have me retire. In fact, I have made up my mind that
      you never intended that I should be president&mdash;I have all along been
      suspicious about it. But I can assure you that you have struck the wrong
      man; you cannot play with me in any such manner. I have no idea whatever
      of retiring from the railroad and permitting you and Mr. Price to exploit
      it, and to deprive me of the value of my holdings&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was going on, but the other interrupted him quickly. &ldquo;I recognise
      the justice of what you say there, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So far as your
      own shares are concerned, you are entitled to be bought out. I am sure
      that that is a fair basis&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;it's a basis the suggestion of which I
      take as an insult. I have been the means of placing other people at your
      mercy. My reputation and my promises were used for that purpose, and to
      whatever I am entitled, they are entitled equally. There can be no
      possible settlement except the one which I have offered you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder could think of nothing more to say. He sat staring at the other. And
      Montague, who had no desire to prolong the interview, arose abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not expect you to decide this matter immediately,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      presume that you will wish to consult with Mr. Price. I have made known my
      terms to you, and I have nothing more to say. Either you will accept the
      terms, or I shall drop everything else, and prepare to fight you at every
      step. I expect to receive the stock by this evening's mail, and I am
      obliged to ask you to favour me with a decision by to-morrow noon, so that
      we can close the matter up without delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that he bowed formally and took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning's mail brought him a letter from William E. Davenant. &ldquo;My
      dear Mr. Montague,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;It is reported to me that you have
      thirty-five hundred shares of the stock of the Northern Mississippi
      Railroad which you desire to sell at fifty dollars a share. If you will
      bring the stock to my office to-day, I shall be glad to purchase it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having received the letters from the South, Montague went immediately.
      Davenant was formal; but Montague could catch a humorous twinkle in his
      eye, which seemed to say, quite confidentially, that he appreciated the
      joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ends the matter,&rdquo; he said, as he blotted the last of Montague's
      signatures. &ldquo;And I trust you will permit me to say, Mr. Montague, that I
      consider you an exceedingly capable business man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appreciate the compliment,&rdquo; replied Montague, drily.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montague was now a gentleman of leisure, comparatively speaking. He had
      two cases on his hands, but they did not occupy his time as had the
      prospect of running a railroad. They were contingency cases, and as they
      were against large corporations, Montague saw a lean year ahead of him. He
      smiled bitterly to himself as he realised that the only thing which had
      given him the courage to break with Price and Ryder had been the money
      which he and his brother Oliver had won by means of a Wall Street &ldquo;tip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He received a letter from Alice. &ldquo;I am going to remain a couple of weeks
      longer in Newport,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Who do you think has invited me&mdash;Laura
      Hegan. She has been perfectly lovely to me, and I go to her place next
      week. You will be interested to know that I had a long talk with her about
      you; I took occasion to tell her a few things that she ought to know. She
      was very nice about it. I am hoping that you will come up for another week
      end before I leave here. Harry Curtiss is going to spend his vacation
      here; you might come with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague smiled to himself as he read this letter. He did not go with
      Curtiss. But the heat of the city was stifling, and the thought of the
      surf and the country was alluring, and he went up by way of the Sound one
      Friday night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was invited to dinner at the Hegans'. Jim Hegan was there himself&mdash;for
      the first occasion in three years. Mrs. Hegan declared that it was only
      because she had gone down to New York and fetched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that Montague had ever been with Hegan for any
      length of time. He watched him with interest, for the man was a
      fascinating problem to him. He was so calm and serene&mdash;always
      courteous and friendly. But what was there behind the mask, Montague
      wondered. For forty years this man had toiled and fought in the arena of
      Wall Street, and with only one purpose and one thought in life, so far as
      Montague knew&mdash;the piling up of money. Jim Hegan indulged himself in
      none of the pleasures of rich men. He had no hobbies, and he seldom went
      into company. In his busy times it was said that he would use a dozen
      secretaries, and wear them all out. He was a gigantic engine which drove
      all day and all night&mdash;a machine for the making of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague did not care much for money himself, and he wondered about it.
      What did the man want it for? What did he expect to accomplish by it? What
      was the moral code, the outlook upon life, of a man who gave all his time
      to heaping up money? What reason did he give to himself for his own
      career? Some reason he must have, or he could not be so calm and cheerful.
      Or could it be that he had no thoughts about it at all? Was it simply a
      blind instinct with him? Was he an animal whose nature it was to make
      money, and who was untroubled by any scruples? This last idea seemed
      rather uncanny to Montague; he found himself watching Jim Hegan with a
      kind of awe; thinking of him as some terrible elemental force, blind and
      unconscious, like the lightning or the tornado.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Jim Hegan was one of the wreckers. His fortune had been made by the
      methods which Major Venable had outlined, by buying aldermen and
      legislatures and governors; by getting franchises for nothing and selling
      them for millions; by organising huge swindles and unloading them upon the
      public. And here he sat upon the veranda of his home, in the twilight of
      an August evening, smoking a cigar and telling about an orphan asylum he
      had founded!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was cheerful and kindly; he was even benevolent. And could it be that
      he had no idea of the trail of ruin and distress which he had left behind
      him? Montague found himself possessed by a sudden desire to penetrate
      beneath that reserve; to spring at the man and surprise him with some
      sudden question; to get at the reality of him, to know him as he was. This
      air of power and masterfulness, surely that must be the mask that he wore.
      And how was he to himself? When he was alone with his own conscience?
      Surely there must come doubt and wonder, unhappiness and loneliness!
      Surely, then, the lives that he had wrecked must come back to plague him!
      Surely the memories of treachery and cruelty must make him wince!
    </p>
    <p>
      And from Hegan, Montague's thoughts went to his daughter. She, too, was
      serene and stately; Montague wondered what was in her mind. How much did
      she know about her father's career? Surely she could not have persuaded
      herself that all that she had heard was calumny. There might be question
      about this offence or that, but of the great broad facts there could be no
      question. And did she justify it and excuse it; or was she, too, secretly
      unhappy? And was this the reason for her pride, and for her bitter
      speeches? It was a continual topic of chatter in Society, how Laura Hegan
      had withdrawn herself from all of her mother's affairs, and was
      interesting herself in work in the slums. Could it be that Nemesis had
      overtaken Jim Hegan in the form of his daughter? That she was the
      conscience by which he was to be tormented?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Hegan never talked about his affairs. In all the time that Montague
      spent with him during his two days at Newport, he gave just one hint for
      the other to go upon. &ldquo;Money?&rdquo; he remarked, that evening. &ldquo;I don't care
      about money. Money is just chips to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Life was a game, and the chips were dollars! What he had played for was
      power! And suddenly Montague seemed to see the career of this man,
      unrolled before him like a panorama. He had begun life as an office-boy;
      and above him were all the heights of business and finance; and the ladder
      by which to scale them was money. There were rivals with whom he fought;
      and the overcoming of these rivals had occupied all his time and his
      thought. If he had bought legislatures, it was because his rivals were
      trying to buy them. And perhaps then he did not even know that he was a
      wrecker; perhaps he would not have believed it if anyone had told him! He
      had travelled all the long journey of his life, trampling out opposition
      and crushing everything before him, nourishing in his heart the hope that
      some day, when he had attained to mastery, when there were no more rivals
      to oppose and thwart him&mdash;then he would be free to do good. Then he
      would no longer have to be a wrecker!
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps that was the meaning of his pitiful little effort&mdash;an
      orphan asylum! It seemed to Montague that the gods must shake with
      Olympian laughter when they contemplated the spectacle of Jim Hegan and
      his orphan asylum: Jim Hegan, who could have filled a score of orphan
      asylums with the children of the men whom he had driven to ruin and
      suicide!
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts were seething in Montague's mind, and they would not let
      him rest. Perhaps it was just as well that he did not stay too long that
      evening. After all, what was the use? Jim Hegan was what circumstances had
      made him. Vain was the dream of peace and well doing&mdash;there was
      always another rival! There was a new battle on just at present, if one
      might believe the gossip of the Street; Hegan and Wyman were at each
      other's throats. They would fight out their quarrel, and there was no way
      to prevent them&mdash;even though they pulled down the pillars of the
      nation about each other's heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to just what these men were doing in their struggles, Montague got new
      information every day. The next morning, while he was sitting on the
      piazza of one of the hotels watching the people, he recognised a familiar
      face, and greeted the young engineer, Lieutenant Long, who came and sat
      down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;have you heard anything from our friend Gamble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's back in the bosom of his family again,&rdquo; said the young officer. &ldquo;He
      got tired of the splurge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great fellow, Gamble,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked him very much,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant. &ldquo;He's not beautiful to look
      at, but his heart's in the right place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague thought for a moment, then asked, &ldquo;Did he ever send you your oil
      specifications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet he did!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;And say, they were great! The
      Department will think I'm an expert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a precious lucky thing for me,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;I'd have been
      in quite a predicament, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment. &ldquo;You cannot imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the position that
      we naval officers are in. Do you know, I think some word must have got out
      about that contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so,&rdquo; said Montague, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. By gad, I thought of writing to headquarters about it. I was
      approached no less than three times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;A young chap got himself introduced to me by
      one of my friends here. He stuck by me the whole evening, and afterwards,
      as we were strolling home, he opened up on me in this fashion. He'd heard
      from a friend in Washington that I was one of those who had been asked to
      write specifications for the oil contracts of the Navy; and he had some
      friends who were interested in oil, and who might be able to advise me. He
      hinted that it might be a good thing for me. Just think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can imagine it was unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, it sets a man to thinking,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant. &ldquo;You know
      the men in our service are exposed to that sort of thing all the time, and
      some of them are trying to live a good deal higher than their incomes
      warrant. It's a thing that we've all got to look out for; I can stand
      graft in politics and in business, but when it comes to the Army and Navy&mdash;I
      tell you, that's where I'm ready to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said nothing. He could think of nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gamble said something about your being interested in a fight against the
      Steel Trust,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so,&rdquo; replied Montague. &ldquo;I'm out of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we were saying made me think of the Steel Trust,&rdquo; said the
      Lieutenant. &ldquo;We get some glimpses of that concern in the Navy, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn't thought of that,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask any man in the service about it,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant. &ldquo;It's an old
      scar that we carry around in our souls&mdash;it won't heal. I mean the
      armour-plate frauds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough!&rdquo; said Montague. He carried a long list of indictments
      against the steel kings in his mind; but he had forgotten this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know about it particularly,&rdquo; the other continued, &ldquo;because my father
      was on the board of investigation fifteen years ago. I am disposed to be a
      little keen on the subject, because what he found out at that time
      practically caused his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague darted a keen glance at the young officer, who sat gazing ahead
      in sombre thought. &ldquo;Fancy how a naval man feels,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are told
      that our ships are going to the Pacific, and any hour the safety of the
      nation may depend upon them! And they are covered with rotten armour plate
      that was made by old Harrison, and sold to the Government for four or five
      times what it cost. Take one case that I know about&mdash;the Oregon. I've
      got a brother on board her to-day. During the Spanish War the whole
      country was watching her and praying for her. And I could go on board that
      battleship and put my finger on the spot in her conning-tower that has a
      series of blow-holes straight through the middle of it&mdash;holes that
      old Harrison had drilled through and plugged up with an iron bar. If ever
      that plate was struck by a shell, it would splinter like so much glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague listened, half dazed. &ldquo;Can one see that?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See it? No!&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;It's all on the inside of the plate, of
      course. When they got through with their dirty work, they would treat the
      surface, and who would ever know the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, how can YOU know it?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Because my father had laid before him the history of
      that plate from the hour it was made until it was put in: the original
      copies of the doctored shop records, and the affidavits of the man who did
      the work. He had the same thing in a hundred other cases. I know the man
      who has the papers at this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued the Lieutenant, after a pause, &ldquo;the Government's
      specifications required that each plate should undergo an elaborate set of
      treatments; and the shop records of each plate were kept. But, of course,
      it cost enormous sums to get these treatments right, and even then
      hundreds of the plates would be bad. So when the shop records came up to
      the office, young Ingham and Davidson would go over them and edit them and
      bring them up to standard&mdash;that's the way those brilliant young
      fellows made all the money that they are spending on chorus girls and
      actresses to-day. They would have these shop records recopied, but they
      did not always tear up the old ones, and somebody in the office hid them,
      and that was how the Government got hold of the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds almost incredible!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the story of plate H619, of the Oregon,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant. &ldquo;That
      was one of a whole group of plates, which was selected for the ballistic
      tests at Indian Head. After it had been selected, it was taken back into
      the company's shops at night, and secretly retreated three times. And then
      of course it passed the tests, and the whole group was passed with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was done about it?&rdquo; Montague asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much was ever done about it,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;The Government
      could not afford to let the real facts get out. But, of course, the
      insiders in the Navy knew it, and the memory will last as long as the
      ships last. As I say, it killed my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But weren't the men punished at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a Board appointed to try the case, and they awarded the
      Government about six hundred thousand dollars' damages. There's a man here
      in this hotel now who could tell you that story straight from the inside.&rdquo;
       And the Lieutenant paused and looked about him. Suddenly he stood up, and
      went to the railing and called to a man who was passing on the other side
      of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bates,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Bates of the Express!&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him, do you?&rdquo; asked the Lieutenant. &ldquo;Hello, Bates! Have they put
      you on the Society notes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm hunting interviews,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Montague?
      Glad to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant, &ldquo;and have a seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was talking to Mr. Montague about the armour-plate frauds,&rdquo; he added,
      when the other had drawn up a chair. &ldquo;I told him you knew the story of the
      Government's investigation. Bates comes from Pittsburg, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; Montague replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the first newspaper story I ever worked on,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;Of
      course, the Pittsburg papers didn't print the facts, but I got them all
      the same. And afterwards I came to know intimately a lawyer in Pittsburg
      who had charge of a secret investigation; and every time I read in the
      newspapers that old Harrison has given a new library, it sets my blood to
      boiling all over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think,&rdquo; put in the other, &ldquo;that if somebody could be found to
      tell that story to the American people, they would rise up and drive the
      old scoundrel out of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could never bring it home to him,&rdquo; said Bates; &ldquo;he's too cunning for
      that. He has always turned his dirty work over to other people. You
      remember during the big strike how he ran away and left the job to William
      Roberts; and after it was all over, he came back smiling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then buying out the Government to keep himself from being punished!&rdquo;
       said the Lieutenant, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague turned and looked at him. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the story that Bates's lawyer friend can tell,&rdquo; was the reply.
      &ldquo;The board of officers awarded six hundred thousand dollars' damages to
      the Government; and the case was appealed to the President of the United
      States, and he sold out the Navy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold it out!&rdquo; gasped Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;That's what I call it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One
      day old Harrison startled the country by making a speech in support of the
      President's policy of tariff reform; and the next day the lawyer got word
      that the award was to be scaled down about seventy-five per cent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; added Bates, &ldquo;William Roberts came down from Pittsburg, and
      bought up the Democratic party in Congress; and so the country got neither
      the damages nor the tariff reform. And then a few years later old Harrison
      sold out to the Steel Trust, and got off with a
      four-hundred-million-dollar mortgage on the American people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bates sank back in his chair. &ldquo;It's not a very pleasant topic for a
      holiday afternoon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I can't forget about it. It's this kind
      of thing that does it, you know&mdash;this.&rdquo; And he waved his hand about
      at the gay assemblage. &ldquo;The women spending their money on dresses and
      diamonds, and the men tearing the country to pieces to get it. You'll hear
      people talk about it&mdash;they say these idle rich harm nobody but
      themselves; but I tell you they spread a trail of corruption wherever they
      go. Don't you believe that, Mr. Montague?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take these New England towns,&rdquo; said Bates; &ldquo;and look at the people in
      them. The ones who had any energy got up and went West years ago; and
      those who are left haven't any jaw-bones. Did you ever notice it? And it's
      just the same, wherever this pleasure crowd comes; it turns the men into
      boarding-house keepers and lackeys, and the girls into waitresses and
      prostitutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They learn to take tips!&rdquo; put in the Lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything they've got is for sale to city people,&rdquo; said Bates.
      &ldquo;Politically, there isn't a rottener little corner in the whole United
      States of America than this same Rhode Island&mdash;and how much that's
      saying, you can imagine. You can buy votes on election day as you'd buy
      herrings, and there's not the remotest effort at reform, nor any hope of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak bitterly,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bitter,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;But it doesn't often break out. I hold my
      tongue, and stew in my own juice. We newspaper men see the game, you know.
      We are behind the scenes, and we see the sawdust put into the dolls. We
      have to work in this rottenness all the time, and some of us don't like
      it, I can tell you. But what can we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I spend my time getting facts together, and
      nine times out of ten my newspaper won't print them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you'd quit,&rdquo; said the other, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What better can I do?&rdquo; asked the reporter. &ldquo;I have the facts; and once in
      a while there comes an explosion, and I get my chance. So I stick at the
      job. I can't but believe that if you keep putting these things before the
      people, sometime, sooner or later, they will do something. Sometime there
      will come a man who has a conscience and a voice, and who won't sell out.
      Don't you think so, Mr. Montague?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The summer wore on. At the end of August Alice returned from Newport for a
      couple of days, having some shopping to do before she joined the Prentices
      at their camp in the Adirondacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society had here a new way of enjoying itself. People built themselves
      elaborate palaces in the wilderness, and lived in a fantastic kind of
      rusticity, with every luxury of civilisation included. For this life one
      needed an entirely separate wardrobe, with doeskin hunting-boots and
      mountain-climbing skirts&mdash;all very picturesque and expensive. It
      reminded Montague of a jest that he had heard about Mrs. Vivie Patton,
      whose husband had complained of the expensiveness of her costumes, and
      requested her to wear simpler dresses. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will get
      a lot of simple dresses immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice spent one evening at home, and she took her cousin into her
      confidence. &ldquo;I've an idea, Allan, that Harry Curtiss is going to ask me to
      marry him. I thought it was right to tell you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a suspicion of it,&rdquo; said Montague, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry has a feeling you don't like him,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Montague, &ldquo;not precisely that.&rdquo; He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand about it,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Do you think I ought not to
      marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague studied her face. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you made up your mind
      to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I cannot say that I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;of course there is no use in my talking about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me just what happened between you and him,&rdquo;
       exclaimed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was simply,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;that I found that Curtiss was doing, in a
      business way, something which I considered improper. Other people are
      doing it, of course&mdash;he has that excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has to earn a living,&rdquo; said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;and if he marries, he will have to earn still
      more of a living. He will only place himself still tighter in the grip of
      these forces of corruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did he do?&rdquo; asked Alice, anxiously. Montague told her the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Allan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don't see what there is so very bad about that.
      Don't Ryder and Price own the railroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They own some of it,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Other people own some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the other people have to take their chances,&rdquo; protested the girl; &ldquo;if
      they choose to have anything to do with men like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not familiar with business,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and you don't
      appreciate the situation. Curtiss was elected a director&mdash;he accepted
      a position of trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He simply did it as a favour to Price,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If he hadn't done it,
      Price would only have got somebody else. As you say, Allan, I don't
      understand much about it, but it seems to me it isn't fair to blame a
      young man who has to make his way in the world, and who simply does what
      he finds everybody else doing. Of course, you know best about your own
      affairs; but it always did seem to me that you go out of your way to look
      for scruples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague smiled sadly. &ldquo;That sounds very much like what he said, Alice. I
      guess you have made up your mind to marry him, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice set out, accompanied by Oliver, who was bound for Bertie
      Stuyvesant's imitation baronial castle, in another part of the mountains.
      Betty Wyman was also to be there, and Oliver was to spend a full month.
      But three days later Montague received a telegram, saying that his brother
      would arrive in New York shortly after eight that morning, and to wait at
      his home for him. Montague suspected what this meant; and he had time
      enough to think it over and make up his mind. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, when Oliver
      came in. &ldquo;It's come again, has it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;it has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another 'sure thing'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead sure. Are you coming in?&rdquo; Oliver asked, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think once was enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that, Allan!&rdquo; protested the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, that is perfectly insane! I have information
      straight from the inside&mdash;it's as certain as the sunrise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of that,&rdquo; responded Montague. &ldquo;But I am through with
      gambling in Wall Street. I've seen enough of it, Oliver, and I'm sick of
      it. I don't like the emotions it causes in me&mdash;I don't like the
      things it makes me do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found the money came in useful, didn't you?&rdquo; said Oliver,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can use what I've got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when that's gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that yet. But I'll find some way that I like better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Oliver; &ldquo;it's your own lookout. I will make my own
      little pile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rode down town in a cab together. &ldquo;Where does your information come
      from this time?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same source,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it Transcontinental again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Oliver; &ldquo;it's another stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Mississippi Steel,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague turned and stared at him. &ldquo;Mississippi Steel!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;What's that to you?&rdquo; he added, in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mississippi Steel!&rdquo; Montague ejaculated again. &ldquo;Why, didn't you know
      about my relations with the Northern Mississippi Railroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Oliver; &ldquo;but what's that got to do with Mississippi
      Steel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's Price who is managing the deal&mdash;the man who owns the
      Mississippi Steel Company!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I had forgotten that.&rdquo; Oliver's duties in Society
      did not give him much time to ask about his brother's affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; he added quickly, &ldquo;you won't say anything about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of my business now,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;I'm out of it. But
      naturally I am interested to know. What is it&mdash;a raid on the stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going down,&rdquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague sat staring ahead of him. &ldquo;It must be the Steel Trust,&rdquo; he
      whispered, half to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more likely,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;My tip comes from that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose they are going to try to break Price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I guess they could do it if they made up their mind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he owns a majority of the stock!&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;They can't take it
      away from him outright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if he's got it locked up in his safe,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and if he's
      got no debts or obligations. But suppose he's overextended; and suppose
      some bank has loaned him money on the stock&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was now keenly interested. He went with his brother while the
      latter drew his money from the bank, and called at his brokers and ordered
      them to sell Mississippi Steel. The other was called away then by an
      engagement in court, which occupied him for several hours; when he came
      out, he made for the nearest ticker, and the first figures he saw were
      Mississippi Steel&mdash;quoted at nearly twenty points below the price of
      the morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      The bare figures were eloquent to him of many tragedies; they brought
      before him half a dozen different personalities, with their triumphs and
      despairs. He could read in them the story of a Titan struggle. Oliver had
      made his killing; but what of Price and Ryder? Montague knew that most of
      Price's stock was hypothecated at the Gotham Trust. And now what would
      become of it? And what would become of the Northern Mississippi?
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought the afternoon papers. Their columns were full of the sensational
      events of the day. The bottom had dropped out of Mississippi Steel, as
      they phrased it. The wildest rumours were afloat. The Company was known to
      be making enormous extensions, and it was said to have overreached itself;
      there were whispers that its officers had been speculating, that the
      Company would be unable to meet the next quarterly payment upon its bonds,
      that a receivership would be necessary. There were hints that the concern
      was to be taken over by the Trust, but this was vigorously denied by
      officers of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of which had come like a bolt out of the blue. To Montague it was an
      amazing and terrible thing. It counted little to him that he was out of
      the struggle himself; that he no longer had anything to lose personally.
      He was like a man who had been through an earthquake, and who stood and
      stared at a gaping crack in the ground. Even though he was safe at the
      moment, he could not forget that this was the earth upon which he had to
      spend the rest of his life, and that the next crack might open where he
      stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague could not see that there was the least chance for Price and
      Ryder; he pictured them bowled clean out, and he would not have been
      surprised to read that they were ruined. But apparently they weathered the
      storm. The episode passed with no more than a crop of rumours. Mississippi
      Steel did not go back, however; and he noticed that Northern Mississippi
      stock had also &ldquo;gone off&rdquo; eight or ten points on the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a period of great anxiety in the financial world. Men felt the
      unrest, even though they could not give definite reasons. There had been
      several panics in the stock market throughout the summer; and leading
      financiers and railroad presidents seemed to have got the habit of
      prognosticating the ruin of the country every time they made a speech at a
      banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But apparently men could not agree about the causes of the trouble. Some
      insisted that it was owing to the speeches of the President, to his
      attacks upon the great business interests of the country. Others
      maintained that the world's supply of capital was inadequate, and pointed
      out the destruction of great wars and earthquakes and fires. Others argued
      that there was not enough currency to do the country's business. Now and
      again there rose above the din the shrill voice of some radical who
      declared that the stock collapses had been brought about deliberately; but
      such statements seemed so preposterous that they were received with
      ridicule whenever they were heeded at all. To Montague the idea that there
      were men in the country sufficiently powerful to wreck its business, and
      sufficiently unscrupulous to use their power&mdash;the idea seemed to him
      sensational and absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had a talk about it one evening with Major Venable, who laughed at
      him. The Major named half a dozen men&mdash;Waterman and Duval and Wyman
      among them&mdash;who controlled ninety per cent of the banks in the
      Metropolis. They controlled all three of the big insurance companies, with
      their resources of four or five hundred million dollars; one of them
      controlled a great transcontinental railroad system, which alone kept a
      twenty-or thirty-million dollar &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; for stock-gambling purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any two or three of those men were to make up their minds,&rdquo; declared
      the Major, &ldquo;they could wreck the business of this country in a day. If
      there were stocks they wanted to pick up, they could knock them to any
      price they chose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would they do it?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many ways. You noticed that the last big slump began with the
      worst scarcity of money the Street has known for years. Now suppose those
      men should gradually accumulate a lot of cash in the banks, and make an
      agreement to withdraw it at a certain hour. Suppose that the banks that
      they own, and the banks where they own directors, and the insurance
      companies which they control&mdash;suppose they all did the same! Can't
      you imagine the scurrying around for money, the calling in of loans, the
      rush to realise on holdings? And when you have a public as nervous as ours
      is, when you have credit stretched to the breaking-point, and everybody
      involved&mdash;don't you see the possibilities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems like playing with dynamite,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not as bad as it might be,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;We are saved by the
      fact that these big men don't get together. There are too many jealousies
      and quarrels. Waterman wants easy money, and gets the Treasury Department
      to lend ten millions; Wyman, on the other hand, wants high prices, and he
      goes into the Street and borrows fifteen millions; and so it goes. There
      are a half dozen big banking groups in the city&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are still competing, then?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;For instance, they fight for the patronage of
      the out-of-town banks. The banks all over the country send their reserves
      to New York; it's a matter of four or five hundred million dollars, and
      that's an enormous power. Some of the big banks are agents for one or two
      thousand institutions, and there's the keenest kind of struggle going on.
      It's not an easy thing to follow, of course; but they offer all kinds of
      secret advantages&mdash;there's more graft in it than you'd find in
      Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only one thing about which the banks are agreed,&rdquo; continued the
      other. &ldquo;That is their hatred of the independent trust companies. You see,
      the national banks have to keep twenty-five per cent reserve, while the
      trust companies only keep five per cent. Consequently they do a faster
      business, and they offer four per cent, and advertise widely, and they are
      simply driving the banks to the wall. There are over fifty of them in this
      city alone, and they've got over a billion of the people's money. And,
      mark my word, that is where you'll see blood spilled before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Montague was destined to remember the prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days later occurred an incident which gave him a new light
      upon the situation. His brother came around one afternoon, with a letter
      in his hand. &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what do you make of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague glanced at it, and saw that it was from Lucy Dupree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ollie,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;I find myself in an embarrassing position,
      owing to the fact that some business arrangements upon which I had counted
      have fallen through. The money which I brought with me to New York is
      nearly all gone, and, as you can understand, my position as a stranger is
      a difficult one. I have a note which Stanley Ryder gave me for my stock.
      It is for a hundred and forty thousand dollars, and is due in three
      months. It occurred to me that you might know someone who has some ready
      cash, and who would like to purchase the note. I should be very glad to
      sell it for a hundred and thirty thousand. Please do not mention it except
      in confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what in the world do you suppose that means?&rdquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other stared at him. &ldquo;I am sure I can't imagine,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money did Lucy have when she came here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had three or four thousand dollars. But then, she got ten thousand
      from Stanley Ryder when he bought that stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can't have spent any such sum of money!&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may have invested it,&rdquo; said the other, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invested nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's not what puzzles me,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Why doesn't Ryder
      discount the note himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it! What business has he letting Lucy hawk his notes about
      the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he doesn't know it. Maybe she's trying to keep her affairs from
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Oliver replied. &ldquo;I don't believe anything of the sort. What I
      think is that Stanley Ryder is doing it himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; asked Montague, in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that he is trying to get his own note discounted. I don't
      believe that Lucy would ever come to us of herself. She'd starve first.
      She's too proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Stanley Ryder!&rdquo; protested Montague. &ldquo;The president of the Gotham
      Trust Company!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;It's his own note, and not the Trust
      Company's; and I'll wager you he's hard up for cash. There was a big
      realty company that failed the other day, and I saw that Ryder was one of
      the stockholders. And he's been hit by that Mississippi Steel slump, and
      I'll wager you he's scurrying around to raise money. It's just like Lucy,
      too. Before he gets through, he'll take every dollar she owns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said nothing for a minute or two. Suddenly he clenched his hands.
      &ldquo;I must go up and see her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy had moved from the expensive hotel to which Oliver had taken her, and
      rented an apartment on Riverside Drive. Montague went up early the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and stood in the doorway of the drawing-room and looked at him.
      He saw that she was paler than she had been, and with lines of pain upon
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought you would come some day. How could you stay
      away so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think you would care to see me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. She came and sat down, continuing to gaze at him, with
      a kind of fear in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stretched out his hands to her. &ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Won't
      you come away from here? Won't you come, before it is too late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can I go?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no home,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away from Stanley Ryder,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;He has no right to let you
      throw yourself away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not let me, Allan,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;You must not blame him&mdash;I
      cannot bear it.&rdquo; She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;I saw that letter you wrote to Oliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I asked him not to. It wasn't fair&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you tell me what that means? Will you tell me
      honestly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will tell you,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will help you if you are in trouble,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;but I will not
      help Stanley Ryder. If you are permitting him to use you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan!&rdquo; she gasped, in sudden excitement. &ldquo;You don't think that he knew I
      wrote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how could you!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that he was in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is in trouble, and I wanted to help him, if I could. It was a
      crazy idea, I know; but it was all I could think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't you see that I cannot leave him?&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy. &ldquo;Now of all
      times&mdash;when he needs help&mdash;when his enemies have surrounded him?
      I'm the only person in the world who cares anything about him&mdash;who
      really understands him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague could think of nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how it hurts you,&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;and don't think that I have not
      cared. It is a thought that never leaves me! But some day I know that you
      will understand; and the rest of the world&mdash;I don't care what the
      world says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Lucy,&rdquo; he answered, sadly. &ldquo;I see that I can't be of any help
      to you. I won't trouble you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Another month passed by. Montague was buried in his work, and he caught
      but faint echoes of the storm that rumbled in the financial world. It was
      a thing which he thought of with wonder in future times&mdash;that he
      should have had so little idea of what was coming. He seemed to himself
      like some peasant who digs with bent head in a field, while armies are
      marshalling for battle all around him; and who is startled suddenly by the
      crash of conflict, and the bursting of shells about his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came another great convulsion of the stock market. Stewart, the
      young Lochinvar out of the West, made an attempt to corner copper. One
      heard wild rumours in relation to the crash which followed. Some said that
      a traitor had sold out the pool; others, that there had been a quarrel
      among the conspirators. However that might be, copper broke, and once more
      there were howling mobs on the curb, and a shudder throughout the
      financial district. Then suddenly, like a thunderbolt, came tidings that a
      conference of the big bankers had decreed that the young Lochinvar should
      be forced out of his New York banks. There were rumours that other banks
      were involved, and that there were to be more conferences. Then a couple
      of days later came the news that all the banks of Cummings the Ice King
      were in trouble, and that he too had been forced from the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had never seen anything like the excitement in Wall Street.
      Everyone he met had a new set of rumours, wilder than the last. It was as
      if a great rift in the earth had suddenly opened before the eyes of the
      banking community. But Montague was at an important crisis in a suit which
      he had taken up against the Tobacco Trust; and he had no idea that he was
      in any way concerned in what was taking place. The newspapers were all
      making desperate efforts to allay the anxiety&mdash;they said that all the
      trouble was over, that Dan Waterman had come to the rescue of the
      imperilled institutions. And Montague believed what he read, and went his
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four days after the crisis had developed, he had an engagement to
      dine with his friend Harvey. Montague was tired after a long day in court,
      and as no one else was coming, and he did not intend to dress, he walked
      up town from his office to Harvey's hotel, a place of entertainment much
      frequented by Society people. Harvey rented an entire floor, and had had
      it redecorated especially to suit his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Montague?&rdquo; said the clerk, when he went to the desk.
      &ldquo;Mr. Harvey left a note for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague opened the envelope, and read a hurried scrawl to the effect that
      Harvey had just got word that a bank of which he was a director was in
      trouble, and that he would have to attend a meeting that evening. He had
      telephoned both to Montague's office and to his hotel, without being able
      to find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague turned away. He had no place to go, for his own family was out of
      town; consequently he strolled into the dining-room and ate by himself.
      Afterwards he came out into the lobby, and bought several evening papers,
      and stood glancing over the head-lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a man strode in at the door, and he looked up. It was Winton
      Duval, the banker; Montague had never seen him since the time when they
      had parted in Mrs. Winnie's drawing-room. He did not see Montague, but
      strode past, his brows knit in thought, and entered one of the elevators.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Montague heard a voice at his side. &ldquo;How do you do, Mr.
      Montague?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned. It was Mr. Lyon, the manager of the hotel, whom Siegfried
      Harvey had once introduced to him. &ldquo;Have you come to attend the
      conference?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conference?&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a big meeting of the bankers here to-night,&rdquo; remarked the other.
      &ldquo;It's not supposed to be known, so don't mention it.&mdash;How do you do,
      Mr. Ward?&rdquo; he added, to a man who went past. &ldquo;That's David Ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Montague. Ward was known in the Street by the nickname of
      Waterman's &ldquo;office-boy.&rdquo; He was a high-salaried office-boy&mdash;Waterman
      paid him a hundred thousand a year to manage one of the big insurance
      companies for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he's here, is he?&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waterman is here himself,&rdquo; said Lyon. &ldquo;He came in by the side entrance.
      It's something especially secret, I gather&mdash;they've rented eight
      rooms upstairs, all connecting. Waterman will go in at one end, and Duval
      at the other, and so the reporters won't know they're together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's the way they work it!&rdquo; said Montague, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been looking for some of the newspaper men,&rdquo; Lyon added. &ldquo;But they
      don't seem to have caught on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strolled away, and Montague stood watching the people in the lobby. He
      saw Jim Hegan come and enter the elevator, in company with an elderly man
      whom he recognised as Bascom, the president of the Empire Bank, Waterman's
      own institution. He saw two other men whom he knew as leading bankers of
      the System; and then, as he glanced toward the desk, he saw a tall,
      broad-shouldered man, who had been talking to the clerk, turn around, and
      reveal himself as his friend Bates, of the Express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; thought Montague. &ldquo;The newspaper men are 'on,' after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw Bates's glance sweep the lobby and rest upon him. Montague made a
      movement of greeting with his hand, but Bates did not reply. Instead, he
      strolled toward him, went by without looking at him, and, as he passed,
      whispered in a low, quick voice, &ldquo;Please come into the writing-room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague stood for a moment, wondering; then he followed. Bates went to a
      corner of the room and seated himself. Montague joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter darted a quick glance about, then began hastily: &ldquo;Excuse me,
      Mr. Montague, I didn't want anyone to see us talking. I want to ask you to
      do me a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm running down a story. It is something very important. I can't explain
      it to you now, but I want to get a certain room in this hotel. You have an
      opportunity to do me the service of a lifetime. I'll explain it to you as
      soon as we are alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to rent room four hundred and seven,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;If I can't get
      four hundred and seven, I want five hundred and seven, or six hundred and
      seven. I daren't ask for it myself, because the clerk knows me. But he'll
      let you have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how shall I ask for it?&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just ask,&rdquo; said Bates; &ldquo;it will be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague looked at him. He could see that his friend was labouring under
      great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! please!&rdquo; he whispered, putting his hand on Montague's arm. And
      Montague said, &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and strolled into the lobby again, and went to the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;Mr. Harvey hasn't
      returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I would like to get a room for the evening. I
      would like to be near a friend. Could I get a room on the fourth floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourth?&rdquo; said the clerk, and turned to look at his schedule on the wall.
      &ldquo;Whereabouts&mdash;front or back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you four hundred and five?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred and five? No, that's rented. We have four hundred and one&mdash;four
      hundred and six, on the other side of the hall&mdash;four hundred and
      seven&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take four hundred and seven,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four dollars a day,&rdquo; said the clerk, as he took down the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having any baggage, Montague paid in advance, and followed the boy to
      the elevator. Bates followed him, and another man, a little wiry chap,
      carrying a dress-suit case, also entered with them, and got out at the
      fourth floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy opened the door, and the three men entered the room. The boy
      turned on the light, and proceeded to lower the shades and the windows,
      and to do enough fixing to earn his tip. Then he went out, closing the
      door behind him; and Bates sank upon the bed and put his hands to his
      forehead and gasped, &ldquo;Oh, my God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man who accompanied him had set down his suit-case, and he now
      sat down on one of the chairs, and proceeded to lean back and laugh
      hilariously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague stood staring from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, my God!&rdquo; said Bates, again. &ldquo;I hope I may never go through with a
      job like this&mdash;-I believe my hair will be grey before morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that you haven't told me yet what's the matter,&rdquo; said
      Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; said Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he sat up and stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;don't go back on us! You've no idea how
      I've been working&mdash;and it will be the biggest scoop of a lifetime.
      Promise me that you won't give us away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot promise you,&rdquo; said Montague, laughing in spite of himself,
      &ldquo;until you tell me what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you are not going to like it,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;It was a mean
      trick to play on you, but I was desperate. I didn't dare take the risk
      myself, and Rodney wasn't dressed for the occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't introduced your friend,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, excuse me,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;Mr. Rodney, one of our office-men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now tell me about it,&rdquo; said Montague, taking a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the conference,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;We got a tip about it an hour or so
      ago. They meet in the room underneath us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to find out what's going on,&rdquo; said Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the window. We've got a rope here.&rdquo; And Bates pointed toward the
      suitcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague stared at him, dumfounded. &ldquo;A rope!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You are going to
      let him down from the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said Bates; &ldquo;it's a rear window, and quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for Heaven's sake, man!&rdquo; gasped the other, &ldquo;suppose the rope breaks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it won't break,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;we've got the right sort of rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how will you ever get him up again?&rdquo; Montague exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Bates; &ldquo;he can climb up, or else we can let him
      down to the ground. We've got rope enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose he loses his grip! Suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Bates, easily. &ldquo;You leave that to Rodney. He's
      nimble&mdash;he began life as a steeple-jack. That's why I picked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rodney grinned. &ldquo;I'll take my chances,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague gazed from one to the other, unable to think of another word to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Mr. Bates,&rdquo; he asked finally, &ldquo;do you often do this in your
      profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done it once before,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I wanted some photographs in a
      murder case. I've often tried back windows, and fire-escapes, and such
      things. I used to be a police reporter, you know, and I learned bad
      habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Montague, &ldquo;suppose you were caught?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The office would soon fix that up. The police never
      bother a newspaper man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. &ldquo;Mr. Montague,&rdquo; said Bates, earnestly, &ldquo;I know this is
      a tough proposition&mdash;but think what it means. We get word about this
      conference. Waterman is here&mdash;and Duval&mdash;think of that! Dan
      Waterman and the Oil Trust getting together! The managing editor sent for
      me himself, and he said, 'Bates, get that story.' And what am I to do?
      There's about as much chance of my finding out what goes on in that
      conference&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. &ldquo;Think of what it may mean, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They
      will decide on to-morrow's moves! It may turn the stock market upside
      down. Think of what you could do with the information!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Montague, shaking his head; &ldquo;don't go at me that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bates was gazing at him. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but then maybe you
      have interests of your own; or your friends&mdash;surely this situation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that either,&rdquo; said Montague, smiling; and Bates broke into a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just for the sport of it! Just to fool them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's more like it,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it's your room,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;You can stop us, if you insist.
      But you needn't stay if you don't want to. We'll take all the risk; and
      you may be sure that if we were caught, the hotel would suppress it. You
      can trust me to clear your name&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I'll see it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bates jumped up and stretched out his hand. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Put it
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Rodney pounced upon the dress-suit case, and opened it,
      taking out a coil of wire rope, very light and flexible, and a short piece
      of board. He proceeded to make a loop with the rope, and in this he fixed
      the board for a seat. He then took the blankets from the bed and folded
      them. He took out a pair of heavy calfskin gloves, which he tossed to
      Bates, and a ball of twine, one end of which he tied about his wrist. He
      tossed the ball on the floor, and then turned out the lights in the room,
      raised the shade of the window, and placed the bundle of blankets upon the
      sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates put on the gloves and seized the rope, and Rodney adjusted the seat
      under his thighs. &ldquo;You hold the blankets, if you will be so good, Mr.
      Montague, and keep them in place, if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bates uncoiled some of the rope, and passed it over the top of the
      large bureau which stood beside the window. He brought the rope down to
      the middle of the body of the bureau, so that by this means he could
      diminish the pull of Rodney's weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady now,&rdquo; said the latter; and he climbed over the sill, and, holding
      on with his hands, gradually put his weight against the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now! All ready,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates grasped the line, and, bracing his knees against the bureau, paid
      the rope out inch by inch. Montague held the blankets in place in the
      corner, and Rodney's shoulders and head gradually disappeared below the
      sill. He was still holding on with his hands, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he whispered, and let go, and slowly the rope slid past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague's heart was beating fast with excitement, but Bates was calm and
      businesslike. After he had let out several turns of the rope, he stopped
      and whispered, &ldquo;Look out now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague leaned over the sill. He could see a stream of light from the
      window below him. Rodney was standing upon the cornice at the top of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower,&rdquo; said Montague, as he drew in his head, and once more Bates paid
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he whispered, and Montague looked again. Rodney had cleverly pushed
      himself by the corner of the cornice, and kept himself at one side of the
      window, so that he would not be visible from the inside of the room. He
      made a frantic signal with his hand, and Montague drew back and whispered,
      &ldquo;Lower!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next time he looked out, Rodney was standing upon the sill of the
      window, leaning to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, make fast,&rdquo; muttered Bates. And while he held the rope, Montague
      took it and wound it again around the bureau, and then carried it over and
      made it fast to the leg of the bath-tub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that will hold all right,&rdquo; said Bates; and he went to the window
      and picked up the ball of cord, the other end of which was tied around
      Rodney's wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is for signals,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Morse telegraph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; gasped Montague. &ldquo;You didn't leave much to chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't afford to,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague saw that the hand which held the cord was being jerked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-i-n-d-o-w o-p-e-n,&rdquo; said Bates; and added, &ldquo;By the Lord! we've got
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montague brought a couple of chairs, and the two seated themselves at the
      window for a long wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you learn about this conference?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; whispered the other in his ear. &ldquo;We mustn't make a noise,
      because Rodney will need quiet to hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague saw that the cord was jerking again. Bates spelled out the
      letters one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-a-t-e-r-m-a-n. D-u-v-a-l. He's telling us who's there. David Ward.
      Hegan. Prentice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prentice!&rdquo; whispered Montague. &ldquo;Why, he's up in the Adirondacks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came down on a special train to-day,&rdquo; whispered the other. &ldquo;Ward
      telegraphed him&mdash;I think that's where we got our tip. Henry
      Patterson. He's the real head of the Oil Trust now. Bascom of the Empire
      Bank. He's Waterman's man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can imagine from that list that there's something big going on,&rdquo;
       Bates muttered; and he spelled the names of several other bankers, heads
      of the most important institutions in Wall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking about Stewart,&rdquo; spelled out Rodney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's ancient history,&rdquo; muttered Bates. &ldquo;He's a dead one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P-r-i-c-e,&rdquo; spelled Rodney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I saw him down in the lobby. I rather thought he'd
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to a conference with Waterman!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are deadly enemies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you don't want to let yourself believe things like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; protested Montague. &ldquo;Do you suppose they're not
      enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do suppose it,&rdquo; said Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, man! I can give you positive facts that prove they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For every fact that you bring,&rdquo; laughed the other, &ldquo;I can bring half a
      dozen to show you they are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is perfectly absurd!&rdquo; began Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Bates, and he waited while the string jerked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-c-e,&rdquo; spelled Rodney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Cummings&mdash;another dead one,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;My Lord, but they
      did him up brown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waterman,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;The Steamship Trust was competing with
      his New England railroads, and now it's in the hands of a receiver. Before
      long you'll hear that he's gathered it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think this last smash-up was planned?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planned! My Heavens, man, it was the greatest gobbling up of the little
      fish that I have ever known since I've been in Wall Street!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was Waterman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the Oil Trust. They were after young Stewart. You see, he beat them
      out in Montana, and they had to buy him off for ten million dollars. But
      he was fool enough to come to New York and go in for banking; and now
      they've got his banks, and a good part of his ten millions as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes a man's breath away,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just save your breath-you'll need it to-night,&rdquo; said Bates, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other sat in thought for a moment. &ldquo;We were talking about Price,&rdquo; he
      whispered. &ldquo;Do you mean John S. Price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one Price that I know of,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't believe that he and Waterman are enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Price is simply one of Waterman's agents in every big thing
      he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, man! Doesn't he own the Mississippi Steel Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He owns it for Waterman,&rdquo; said Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is impossible,&rdquo; cried Montague. &ldquo;Isn't Waterman interested in
      the Steel Trust? And isn't Mississippi Steel its chief competitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is supposed to be,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But that is simply a bluff to
      fool the public. There has been no real competition between them ever
      since four years ago, when Price raided the stock and captured it for
      Waterman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was staring at his friend, almost speechless with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bates,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it happens that I was very recently connected with
      Price and the Mississippi Steel Company in a very intimate way; and I know
      most positively that what you say is not true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very hard to answer a statement like that,&rdquo; Bates responded. &ldquo;I'd
      have to know just what your facts are. But they'd have to be very
      convincing indeed to make an impression upon me, for I ran that story down
      pretty thoroughly. I got it straight from the inside, and I got all the
      details of it. I nailed Price down, right in his own office. The only
      trouble was that my people wouldn't print the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before Montague spoke again. He was groping around in his
      own mind, trying to grasp the significance of what Bates had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Price was fighting Waterman!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The whole crowd were
      fighting him! That was the whole purpose of what they were doing. It had
      no sense otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you sure?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;Think it over. Suppose they were
      only pretending to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; Bates added, &ldquo;I am only speaking about Price himself. I don't
      know about any people he may have been with. He may have been deceiving
      them&mdash;he may have been leading them into a trap&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly Montague clutched the arms of his chair. He sat staring ahead
      of him, struck dumb by the thought which the other's words had brought to
      him. &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he gasped; and again, and yet again, &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to unroll before him, in vista after vista. Price deceiving
      Ryder! leading him into that Northern Mississippi deal; getting him to
      lend money upon the stock of the Mississippi Steel Company; promising,
      perhaps, to support the stock in the market, and helping to smash it
      instead! Twisting Ryder around his finger, crushing him&mdash;and why? And
      why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague's thoughts stopped still. It was as if he had found himself
      suddenly confronted by a bottomless abyss. He shrank back from it. He
      could not face the thought in his own mind. Waterman! It was Dan Waterman!
      It was something which he had planned! It was the vengeance that he had
      threatened! He had been all this time plotting it, setting his nets about
      Ryder's feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an idea so wild and so horrible that Montague fought it off. He
      pushed it away from him, again and again. No, no, it could not be!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, why not? He had always felt certain in his own mind that that
      detective had come from Waterman. The old man had set to work to find out
      about Lucy and her affairs, the first time that he had ever laid eyes on
      her. And then suddenly Montague saw the face of volcanic fury that had
      flashed past him on board the <i>Brünnhilde</i>. &ldquo;You will hear from me
      again,&rdquo; the old man had said; and now, all these months of silence&mdash;and
      at last he heard!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not? Why not? Montague kept asking himself. After all, what did he
      know about the Mississippi Steel Company? What had he ever seen to prove
      that it was actually competing with the Trust? What had he even heard,
      except what Stanley Ryder had told him; and what more likely than that
      Ryder was simply repeating what Price had said?
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had forgotten all about his present situation in the rush of
      thoughts which had come to him. The cord had been jerking again, and had
      spelled out the names of several more of the masters of the city who had
      arrived; but he had not heard their names. &ldquo;What object would there be,&rdquo;
       he asked, &ldquo;in keeping the fact a secret&mdash;I mean that Price was
      Waterman's agent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Object!&rdquo; exclaimed Bates. &ldquo;Good Heavens, and with the public half crazy
      about monopolies, and the President making such a fight! If it were known
      that the Steel Trust had gathered in its last big competitor, you can't
      tell what the Government might do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;And how long has this been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;all they're waiting for is some occasion
      like this, when they can put the Company in a hole, and pose as
      benefactors in taking it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Bates, and leaned out of the window. He could catch faintly
      the sounds of a deep voice in the consultation room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-a-t-e-r-m-a-n,&rdquo; spelled Rodney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess business has begun,&rdquo; whispered Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Situation intolerable,&rdquo; spelled Rodney. &ldquo;End wildcat banking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means end of opposition to me,&rdquo; was the other's comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duval assents,&rdquo; continued Rodney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two in the window were on edge by this time. It was tantalising to
      have to wait several minutes, and then get only such snatches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they'll get past the speech-making pretty soon,&rdquo; whispered Bates; and
      indeed they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two words which the cord spelled out made Montague sit up and
      clutch the arms of his chair again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gotham Trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; whispered Bates. Montague made not a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ryder misusing,&rdquo; spelled the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates seized his companion by the arm, and leaned close to him. &ldquo;By the
      Lord!&rdquo; he whispered breathlessly, &ldquo;I wonder if they're going to smash the
      Gotham Trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refuse clearing,&rdquo; spelled Rodney; and Montague felt Bates's hand
      trembling. &ldquo;They refuse to clear for Ryder!&rdquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague was beyond all speech; he sat as if turned to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; spelled the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates could hardly keep still for his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you catch what that means?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The Clearing-house is to
      throw out the Gotham Trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they'll wreck it!&rdquo; panted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, my God, they're mad!&rdquo; cried Bates. &ldquo;Don't they realise what
      they'll do? There'll be a panic such as New York has never seen before! It
      will bring down every bank in the city! The Gotham Trust! Think of it!&mdash;the
      Gotham Trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prentice objects,&rdquo; came Rodney's next message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Objects!&rdquo; exclaimed Bates, striking his knee in repressed excitement. &ldquo;I
      should think he might object. If the Gotham Trust goes down, the Trust
      Company of the Republic won't live for twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid,&rdquo; spelled the cord. &ldquo;Patterson angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much he has to lose,&rdquo; muttered Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague started up and began to pace the room. &ldquo;Oh, this is horrible,
      horrible!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all the images of the destruction and suffering which Bates's
      words brought up before him, his thoughts flew back to a pale and
      sad-faced little woman, sitting alone in an apartment up on the Riverside.
      It was to her that it all came back; it was for her that this terrible
      drama was being enacted. Montague could picture the grim, hawk-faced old
      man, sitting at the head of the council board, and laying down the law to
      the masters of the Metropolis. And this man's thoughts, too, went back to
      Lucy&mdash;his and Montague's alone, of all those who took part in the
      struggle!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waterman protect Prentice,&rdquo; spelled Rodney. &ldquo;Insist turn out Ryder.
      Withdraw funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no doubt of it,&rdquo; whispered Bates; &ldquo;they can finish him if they
      choose. But oh, my Lord, what will happen in New York to-morrow!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ward protect legitimate banks,&rdquo; was the next message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little whelp!&rdquo; sneered Bates. &ldquo;By legitimate banks he means those
      that back his syndicates. A lot of protecting he will do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But then the newspaper man in Bates rose to the surface. &ldquo;Oh, what a
      story,&rdquo; he whispered, clenching his hands, and pounding his knees. &ldquo;Oh,
      what a story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague carried away but a faint recollection of the rest of Rodney's
      communications; he was too much overwhelmed by his own thoughts. Bates,
      however, continued to spell out the words; and he caught the statement
      that General Prentice, who was a director in the Gotham Trust, was to vote
      against any plan to close the doors of that institution. While they were
      after it, they were going to finish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also he caught the sentence, &ldquo;Panic useful, curb President!&rdquo; And he heard
      Bates's excited exclamations over that. &ldquo;Did you catch that?&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;That's Waterman! Oh, the nerve of it! We are in at the making of history
      to-night, Mr. Montague.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps half an hour later, Montague, standing beside Bates, saw his hand
      jerked violently several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means pull up!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he seized the rope. &ldquo;Put your weight on it,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It will
      hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded to haul. Rodney helped them by catching hold of the cornice
      of the window and lifting himself. Then there was a moment of great
      straining, during which Montague held his breath; after which the weight
      grew lighter again. Rodney had got his knees upon the cornice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later his fingers appeared, clutching the edge of the sill.
      He swung himself up, and Montague and Bates grasped him under the arms,
      and fairly jerked him into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staggered to his feet; and there was a moment's pause, while all three
      caught their breath. Then Rodney leaped at Bates, and grasped him by the
      shoulders. &ldquo;Old man!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We landed them! We landed them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We landed them!&rdquo; laughed the other in exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a scoop!&rdquo; shouted Rodney. &ldquo;There was never one like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two were like schoolboys in their glee. They hugged each other, and
      laughed and danced about. But it was not long before they became serious
      again. Montague turned on the lights, and pulled down the window; and
      Rodney stood there, with his clothing dishevelled and his face ablaze with
      excitement, and talked to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can't imagine that scene!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It makes my hair stand on
      end to think of it. Just fancy&mdash;I was not more than twenty feet from
      Dan Waterman, and most of the time he seemed to be glaring right at me. I
      hardly dared wink, for fear he'd notice; and I thought every instant he
      would jump up and run to the window. But there he sat, and pounded on the
      table, and glared about at those fellows, and laid down the law to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard him talk,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;I know how it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he fairly knocked them over!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;You could have heard
      a pin drop when he got through. Oh, it was a mad thing to see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've hardly been able to get my breath,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;I can't believe
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have no idea what it will mean,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know,&rdquo; said Rodney; &ldquo;but they don't care. They've smelt blood.
      That's about the size of it&mdash;they were like a lot of hounds on the
      trail. You should have seen Waterman, with that lean, hungry face of his.
      'The time has come,' said he. 'There's no one here but has known that
      sooner or later this work had to be done. We must crush them, once and for
      all time!' And you should have seen him turn on Prentice, when he ventured
      a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prentice doesn't like it, then?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he wouldn't!&rdquo; put in Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waterman said he'd protect him,&rdquo; said Rodney. &ldquo;But he must place himself
      absolutely in their hands. It seems that the Trust Company of the Republic
      has a million dollars with the Gotham Trust, and that's to be withdrawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine it!&rdquo; gasped Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wait!&rdquo; exclaimed the other; &ldquo;then they got on to politics. I would
      have given one arm if I could have got a photograph of Dan Waterman at
      that moment&mdash;just to spread it before the American people and ask
      them what they thought of it! David Ward had made the remark that 'A
      little trouble mightn't have a bad effect just now.' And Waterman brought
      down his fist on the table. 'This country needs a lesson,' he cried.
      'There's been too much abuse of responsible men, and there's been too much
      wild talk in high places. If the people get a little taste of hard times,
      they'll have something else to think about besides abusing those who have
      made the prosperity of the country; and it seems to me, gentlemen, that we
      have it in our power to put an end to this campaign of radicalism.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it, think of it!&rdquo; gasped Bates. &ldquo;The old devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then Duval chimed in, with a laugh, 'To put it in a nutshell,
      gentlemen, we are going to smash Ryder and scare the President!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the conference over?&rdquo; asked Bates, after a moment's pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All but the hand-shakes,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I didn't dare to stay while
      they were moving about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bates started suddenly to his feet. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We haven't any
      time to waste. Our work isn't done yet, by a long sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to untie the rope and coil it up. Rodney took the blanket and
      put it on the bed, covering it with the spread, so as to conceal the holes
      which had been worn by the rope. He wound up the ball of cord, and dropped
      it into the bag with the rest of the stuff. Bates took his hat and coat
      and started for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse us, Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can understand that this
      story will need a lot of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll try to thank you by and by,&rdquo; added the other. &ldquo;Come around after
      the paper goes to press, and we'll have a celebration.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      They went out; and Montague waited a minute or two, to give them a chance
      to get out of the way, and then he rang the elevator bell and entered the
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stopped again at the next floor, and he gave a start of excitement. As
      the door opened, he saw a group of men, with Duval, Ward, and General
      Prentice among them. He moved behind the elevator man, so that none of
      them should notice him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had caught one glimpse of the face of General Prentice. It was
      deathly pale. The General said not a word to anyone, but went out into the
      corridor. The other hesitated for a moment, then, with a sudden
      resolution, he turned and followed. As his friend passed out of the door,
      he stepped up beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, General,&rdquo; he said. The General turned and stared at him,
      half in a daze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Montague!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street outside, among a group of half a dozen automobiles, he
      recognised the General's limousine car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ride with you, if you like,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I've something to say
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the General. He could not very well have refused, for
      Montague had taken him by the arm and started toward the car; he did not
      intend to be put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped the General in, got in himself, and shut to the door behind him.
      Prentice sat staring in front of him, still half in a daze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague watched him for a minute or so. Then suddenly he leaned toward
      him, and said, &ldquo;General, why do you let them persuade you to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; repeated Montague, &ldquo;why do you let them persuade you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other turned and stared at him, with a startled look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about what has happened,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I know what went on
      at that conference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; gasped the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what they made you promise to do. They are going to wreck the
      Gotham Trust Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General was dumfounded. &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;How? Who told you? How
      could you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague had to wait a minute or two until his friend had got over his
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; he burst out, finally. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can refuse to play their game!&rdquo; exclaimed Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you suppose that they would do it just the same? And how long
      do you suppose that I would last, if I refused them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think of what it means!&rdquo; cried Montague. &ldquo;Think of the ruin! You will
      bring everything about your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; cried the General, in a voice of anguish. &ldquo;Don't think
      that I haven't realised it&mdash;don't think that I haven't fought against
      it! But I am helpless, utterly helpless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned upon Montague, and caught his sleeve with a trembling hand. &ldquo;I
      never thought that I would live to face such an hour,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;To
      despise myself&mdash;to be despised by all the world! To be browbeaten,
      and insulted, and dragged about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man paused, choking with excess of emotion. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; he
      cried, with sudden vehemence. &ldquo;Look at me! You think that I am a man, a
      person of influence in the community, the head of a great institution in
      which thousands of people have faith. But I am nothing of the kind. I am a
      puppet&mdash;I am a sham&mdash;I am a disgrace to myself and to the name I
      bear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he clasped his hands over his face, and bowed his head, so
      that Montague should not see his grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Montague was dumb with horror. He felt that his
      mere presence was an outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the General looked up again. He clenched his hand, and mastered
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have chosen my part,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must play it through. What I feel
      about it makes no difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague again said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to inflict my grief upon you,&rdquo; the General continued. &ldquo;I
      have no right to try to excuse myself. There is no turning back now. I am
      Dan Waterman's man, and I do his bidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you have got into such a position?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of mine organised the Trust Company of the Republic. He asked me
      to become president, because I had a name that would be useful to him. I
      accepted&mdash;he was a man I knew I could trust. I managed the business
      properly, and it prospered; and then, three years ago, the control was
      bought by other men. That was when the crisis came. I should have
      resigned. But I had my family to think of; I had friends who were
      involved; I had interests that I could not leave. And I stayed&mdash;and
      that is all. I found that I had stayed to be a puppet, a figurehead. And
      now it is too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can't you withdraw now?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo; echoed the General. &ldquo;Now, in the most critical moment, when all my
      friends are hanging upon me? There is nothing that my enemies would like
      better, for they could lay all their sins at my door. They would class me
      with Stewart and Ryder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Montague, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now the crisis comes, and I find out who my real master is. I am told
      to do this, and do that, and I do it. There are no threats; I understand
      without any. Oh, my God, Mr. Montague, if I should tell you of some of the
      things that I have seen in this city&mdash;of the indignities that I have
      seen heaped upon men, of the deeds to which I have seen them driven. Men
      whom you think of as the most honourable in the community&mdash;men who
      have grown grey in the service of the public! It is too brutal, too
      horrible for words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is nothing you can do?&rdquo; asked Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, General, is your institution sound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have done nothing improper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should you fear Waterman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; exclaimed the General. &ldquo;Because I am liable for eighty per cent of
      my deposits, and I have only five per cent of reserves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a choice between Stanley Ryder and myself,&rdquo; added the other. &ldquo;And
      Stanley Ryder will have to fight his own battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more said. Each of the men sat buried in his own
      thoughts, and the only sound was the hum of the automobile as it sped up
      Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague was working out another course of action. He moved to another
      seat in the car where he could see the numbers upon the street lamps as
      they flashed by; and at last he touched the General upon the knee. &ldquo;I will
      leave you at the next corner,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General pressed the button which signalled his chauffeur, and the car
      drew up at the curb. Montague descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, General,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said the other, in a faint voice. He did not offer to take
      Montague's hand. The latter closed the door of the car, and it sped away
      up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he crossed over and went down to the River drive, and entered Lucy's
      apartment house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Taylor in?&rdquo; he asked of the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see,&rdquo; said the man. Montague gave his name and added, &ldquo;Tell her it
      is very important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy came to the door herself, clad in an evening gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance at his haggard face was enough to tell her that something was
      wrong. &ldquo;What is it, Allan?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung up his hat and coat, and went into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Allan?&rdquo; she cried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy, do you know where Stanley Ryder is?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, and added quickly, &ldquo;Oh! it's some bad news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He must be found at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him for a moment, hesitating; then, her anxiety overcoming
      every other emotion, she said, &ldquo;He is in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy ran to the door. &ldquo;Come in. Quickly!&rdquo; she called, and Ryder appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague saw that he was very pale; and there was nothing left of his air
      of aristocratic serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have just come into possession of some news
      which concerns you very closely. I felt that you ought to know. There is
      to be a directors' meeting to-morrow morning, at which it is to be decided
      that the bank which clears for the Gotham Trust Company will discontinue
      to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder started as if he had been shot; his face turned grey. There was no
      sound except a faint cry of fright from Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My information is quite positive,&rdquo; continued Montague. &ldquo;It has been
      determined to wreck your institution!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder caught at a chair to support himself. &ldquo;Who? Who?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Duval and Waterman,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan Waterman!&rdquo; It was Lucy who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague turned to look at her, and saw her eyes, wide open with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lucy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; she gasped, choking; then suddenly she cried wildly, &ldquo;Tell me! I
      don't understand&mdash;what does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that I am ruined,&rdquo; exclaimed Ryder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruined?&rdquo; she echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They've got me! I knew they were after me, but I
      didn't think they'd dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ended with a furious imprecation; but Montague had kept his eyes fixed
      upon Lucy. It was her suffering that he cared about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her whisper, under her breath, &ldquo;It's for me!&rdquo; And then again,
      &ldquo;It's for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; he began; but suddenly she put up her hand, and rushed toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! he doesn't know!&rdquo; she panted breathlessly. &ldquo;I haven't told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she turned toward Ryder again. &ldquo;Oh, surely there must be some
      way,&rdquo; she cried, wildly. &ldquo;Surely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ryder had sunk down in a chair and buried his face in his hands. &ldquo;Ruined!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed. &ldquo;Utterly ruined! I won't have a dollar left in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Lucy, &ldquo;it cannot be!&rdquo; And she put her hands to her
      forehead, striving to think. &ldquo;It must be stopped. I'll go and see him.
      I'll plead with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not, Lucy!&rdquo; cried Montague, starting toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again she whirled upon him. &ldquo;Not a word!&rdquo; she whispered, with fierce
      intensity. &ldquo;Not a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she rushed into the next room, and half a minute later came back with
      her hat and wrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell them to call me a cab!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to protest again; but she would not hear him. &ldquo;You can ride with
      me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can talk then. Call me a cab! Please&mdash;save me
      that trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave the message: and Lucy, meanwhile, stood in the middle of the room,
      twisting her hands together nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Allan, go downstairs,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;wait for me there.&rdquo; And after
      another glance at the broken figure of Ryder, he took his hat and coat and
      obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague spent his time pacing back and forth in the entrance-hall. The
      cab arrived, and a minute later Lucy appeared, wearing a heavy veil. She
      went straight to the vehicle, and sprang in, and Montague followed. She
      gave the driver the address of Waterman's great marble palace over by the
      park; and the cab started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly she turned upon Montague, speaking swiftly and intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you are going to say,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But you must spare me&mdash;and
      you must spare yourself. I am sorry that you should have to know this&mdash;God
      knows that I could not help it! But it cannot be undone. And there is no
      other way out of it. I must go to him, and try to save Ryder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;listen to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to listen to you,&rdquo; she cried wildly&mdash;almost
      hysterically. &ldquo;I cannot bear to be argued with. It is too hard for me as
      it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think of the practical side of it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do you imagine that
      you can stop this huge machine that Waterman has set in motion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, I don't know!&rdquo; she exclaimed, choking back a sob. &ldquo;I can
      only do what I can. If he has any spark of feeling in him&mdash;I'll get
      down on my knees to him, I will beg him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Lucy! think of what you are doing. You go there to his house at
      night! You put yourself into his power!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care, Allan&mdash;I am not afraid of him. I have thought about
      myself too long. Now I must think about the man I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague did not answer, for a moment. &ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;will you
      tell me how you have thought of yourself in one single thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I will!&rdquo; she cried, vehemently. &ldquo;I have known all along
      that Waterman was following me. I have been haunted by the thought of him&mdash;I
      have felt his power in everything that has befallen us. And I have never
      once told Ryder of his peril!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was more a kindness to him&mdash;&rdquo; began the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; panted Lucy; and she caught his coat sleeve in her trembling
      hands. &ldquo;You see, you see&mdash;you cannot even imagine it of me! I kept it
      a secret&mdash;because I was afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid that Ryder would leave me! I was afraid that he would give
      me up! And I loved him too much!&mdash;Now,&rdquo; she rushed on&mdash;&ldquo;you see
      what kind of a person I have been! And I can sit here, and tell you that!
      Is there anything that can make me ashamed after that? Is there anything
      that can degrade me after that? And what is there left for me to do but go
      to Waterman and try to undo what I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague was speechless, before the agony of her humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; he began, protesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly she caught him by the arm. &ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I know
      that you have to try to stop me. But it is no use, and I must do it! And I
      cannot bear to hear you&mdash;it makes it too hard for me. My course is
      chosen, and nothing in the world can turn me; and I want you to go away
      and leave me. I want you to go&mdash;right now! I am not afraid of
      Waterman; I am not afraid of anything that he can do. I am only afraid of
      you, and your unhappiness. I want you to leave me to my fate! I want you
      to stop thinking about me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do it, Lucy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached up and pulled the signal cord; and the cab came to a halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to get out, Allan!&rdquo; she cried wildly. &ldquo;Please get out, and go
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started to protest again; but she pushed him away in frenzy. &ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo;
       she cried; and half dazed, and scarcely realising what he did, he gave way
      to her and stepped out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive!&rdquo; she called to the man, and shut the door; and Montague found
      himself standing on a driveway in the park, with the lights of the cab
      disappearing around a turn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montague started to walk. He had no idea where he went; his mind was in a
      whirl, and he was lost to everything about him. He must have spent a
      couple of hours wandering about the park and the streets of the city; when
      at last he stopped and looked about him, he was on a lighted thoroughfare,
      and a big clock in front of a jewellery store was pointing to the hour of
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked around. Immediately across the street was a building which he
      recognised as the office of the Express; and in a flash he thought of
      Bates. &ldquo;Come in after the paper has gone to press,&rdquo; the latter had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in and entered the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Mr. Bates, a reporter,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;City-room,&rdquo; said the elevator man; &ldquo;eleventh floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague confronted a very cross and sleepy-looking office-boy. &ldquo;Is Mr.
      Bates in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the boy, and slowly let himself down from the table upon
      which he had been sitting. Montague produced a card, and the boy
      disappeared. &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said, when he returned; and Montague found
      himself in a huge room, crowded with desks and chairs. Everything was in
      confusion; the floor was literally buried out of sight in paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague observed that there were only about a dozen men in the room; and
      several of these were putting on their coats. &ldquo;There he is, over there,&rdquo;
       said the office-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked and saw Bates sitting at a desk, with his head buried in his
      arms. &ldquo;Tired,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bates,&rdquo; he said; then, as the other looked up, he gave a start of
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half a minute before Bates replied. His voice was husky. &ldquo;They sold
      me out,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sold me out!&rdquo; repeated Bates, and struck the table in front of him.
      &ldquo;Cut out the story, by God! Did me out of my scoop!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that, sir,&rdquo; he added, and shoved toward Montague a double column
      of newspaper proofs, with a huge head-line, &ldquo;Gotham Trust Company to be
      Wrecked,&rdquo; and the words scrawled across in blue pencil, &ldquo;Killed by orders
      from the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague could scarcely find words to reply. He drew up a chair and sat
      down. &ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing much to tell,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;They sold me out. They
      wouldn't print it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn't you take it elsewhere?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; said Bates; &ldquo;the scoundrels&mdash;they never even let me
      know!&rdquo; He poured out his rage in a string of curses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told Montague the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in here at half-past ten,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I reported to the managing
      editor. He was crazy with delight, and told me to go ahead&mdash;front
      page, double column, and all the rest. So Rodney and I set to work. He did
      the interview, and I did all the embroidery&mdash;oh, my God, but it was a
      story! And it was read, and went through; and then an hour or two ago,
      just when the forms were ready, in comes old Hodges&mdash;he's one of the
      owners, you know&mdash;and begins nosing round. 'What's this?' he cries,
      and reads the story; and then he goes to the managing editor. They almost
      had a fight over it. 'No paper that I am interested in shall ever print a
      story like that!' says Hodges; and the managing editor threatens to
      resign, but he can't budge him. The first thing I knew of it was when I
      got this copy; and the paper had already gone to press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose was the reason for it?&rdquo; asked Montague, in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reason?&rdquo; echoed Bates. &ldquo;The reason is Hodges; he's a crook. 'If we
      publish that story,' he said, 'the directors of the bank will never meet,
      and we'll bear the onus of having wrecked the Gotham Trust Company.' But
      that's all a bluff, and he knew it; we could prove that that conference
      took place, if it ever came to a fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite safe, it seems to me,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe?&rdquo; echoed Bates. &ldquo;We had the greatest scoop that a newspaper ever had
      in this country&mdash;if only the Express were a newspaper. But Hodges
      isn't publishing the news, you see; he's serving his masters, whoever they
      are. I knew that it meant trouble when he bought into the Express. He used
      to be managing editor of the Gazette, you know; and he made his fortune
      selling the policy of that paper&mdash;its financial news is edited to
      this very hour in the offices of Wyman's bankers, and I can prove it to
      anybody who wants me to. That's the sort of proposition a man's up
      against; and what's the use of gathering the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bates rose up with an oath, kicking away the chair behind him. &ldquo;Come
      on,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let's get out of here. I don't know that I'll ever come
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague spent another hour wandering about with Bates, listening to his
      opinion of the newspapers of the Metropolis. Then, utterly exhausted, he
      went home; but not to sleep. He sat in a chair for an hour or two, his
      mind besieged by images of ruin and destruction. At last he lay down, but
      he had not closed his eyes when daylight began to stream into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock he was up again and at the telephone. He called up Lucy's
      apartment house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to Mrs. Taylor,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not in,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ring up the apartment?&rdquo; asked Montague. &ldquo;I will speak to the
      maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he said, when he heard the woman's voice. &ldquo;Where
      is Mrs. Taylor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not come back, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had some work before him that day which could not be put off.
      Accordingly he bathed and shaved, and had some coffee in his room, and
      then set out for his office. Even at that early hour there were crowds in
      the financial district, and another day's crop of rumours had begun to
      spring. He heard nothing about the Gotham Trust Company; but when he left
      court at lunch time, the newsboys on the street were shouting the
      announcement of the action of the bank directors. Lucy had failed in her
      errand, then; the blow had fallen!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was almost a panic on the Exchange that day, and the terror and
      anxiety upon the faces of the people who thronged the financial district
      were painful to see. But the courts did not suspend, even on account of
      the Gotham Trust; and Montague had an important case to argue. He came out
      on the street late in the afternoon, and though it was after banking
      hours, he saw crowds in front of a couple of the big trust companies, and
      he read in the papers that a run upon the Gotham Trust had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his office he found a telegram from his brother Oliver, who was still
      in the Adirondacks: &ldquo;Money in Trust Company of the Republic. Notify me of
      the slightest sign of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied that there was none; and, as he rode up in the subway, he
      thought the problem over, and made up his own mind. He had a trifle over
      sixty thousand dollars in Prentice's institution&mdash;more than half of
      all he owned. He had Prentice's word for it that the Company was in a
      sound condition, and he believed it. He made up his mind that he would not
      be one of those to be stampeded, whatever might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dined quietly at home with his mother; then he took his way up town
      again to Lucy's apartment; for he was haunted by the thought of her, and
      could not rest. He had read in the late evening papers that Stanley Ryder
      had resigned from the Gotham Trust Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Taylor in?&rdquo; he asked, and gave his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor says will you please to wait, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. And
      Montague sat down in the reception-room. A couple of minutes later, the
      hall-boy brought him a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened it and read these words, in a trembling hand:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Allan: It is good of you to try to help me, but I cannot bear it.
      Please go away. I do not want you to think about me. Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague could read the agony between those lines; but there was nothing
      he could do about it. He went over to Broadway, and started to walk down
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he must have someone to talk to, to take his mind off these
      things. He thought of the Major, and went over to the club, but the storm
      had routed out even the Major, it appeared. He was just off to attend some
      conference, and had only time to shake hands with Montague, and tell him
      to &ldquo;trim sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of Bates, and went down to the office of the Express. He
      found Bates hard at work, seated at a table in his shirt-sleeves, and with
      stacks of papers around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can always spare time for a chat,&rdquo; he said, as Montague offered to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you came back,&rdquo; observed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm like an old horse in a tread mill,&rdquo; answered Bates. &ldquo;What else is
      there for me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair, and put his thumbs in his armholes. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       he remarked, &ldquo;they made their killing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did, indeed,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they're not satisfied yet,&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;They're on another
      trail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;I went in to see David Ward about the action of the
      Clearinghouse Committee; Gary&mdash;he's the Despatch man&mdash;was with
      me. Ward talked for half an hour, as he always does; he told us all about
      the gallant efforts which the bankers were making to stem the tide, and he
      told us that the Trust Company of the Republic was in danger and that an
      agreement had been made to try to save it. Mind you, there's not been the
      least sign of trouble for the company.' 'Shall we print that?' asked Gary.
      'Surely,' said Ward. 'But it will make trouble,' said Gary. 'That's all
      right,' said Ward. 'It's a fact. So print it.' Now what do you think of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague sat rigid. &ldquo;But I thought they had promised to protect Prentice!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bates, grimly; &ldquo;and now they throw him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose Waterman knew that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course; Ward is no more than one of his clerks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will the Despatch print it, do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why not,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I asked Gary if he was going to
      put it in, and he said 'Yes.' 'It will make another panic,' I said, and he
      answered, 'Panics are news.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said nothing for a minute or two. Finally he remarked, &ldquo;I have
      good reason to believe that the Trust Company of the Republic is perfectly
      sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Ask Waterman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's some quarrel
      or other; he wants to put the screws on somebody. Perhaps it's simply that
      two trust companies will scare the President more than one; or perhaps
      it's some stock he wants to break. I've heard it said that he has
      seventy-five millions laid by to pick up bargains with; and I shouldn't
      wonder if it was true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause. &ldquo;And by the way,&rdquo; Bates added, &ldquo;the Oil Trust
      has made another haul! The Electric Manufacturing Company is in trouble&mdash;that's
      a rival of one of their enterprises! Doesn't it all fit together
      beautifully?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague thought for a moment or two. &ldquo;This is rather important news to
      me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I've got money in the Trust Company of the Republic. Do you
      suppose they are going to let it go down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked it over with Rodney,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;He says Waterman was
      quite explicit in his promises to see Prentice through. And there's one
      thing you can say about old Dan&mdash;for all his villainies, he never
      breaks his word. So I imagine he'll save it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, why give out this report?&rdquo; exclaimed the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see?&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;He wants a chance to save it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague's jaw fell. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as plain as the nose on your face,&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;That story will
      come out to-morrow morning, and everybody will say it was the blunder of a
      newspaper reporter; and then Waterman will come forward and do the rescue
      act. It'll be just like a play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's taking a long chance,&rdquo; said Montague, and added, &ldquo;I had thought of
      telling Prentice, who's an intimate friend of mine; but I don't suppose it
      will do him any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Prentice can't help himself,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;All you can do is
      to make him lose a night's sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague went out, with a new set of problems to ponder. As he went home,
      he passed the magnificent building of the Gotham Trust Company, where
      there stood a long line of people who had prepared to spend the night. All
      the afternoon a frantic mob had besieged the doors, and millions of
      dollars had been withdrawn in a few hours. Montague knew that by the time
      he got down town the next morning there would be another such mob in front
      of the Trust Company of the Republic; but he was determined to stand by
      his own resolve. However, he had sent a telegram to Oliver, warning him to
      return at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home and found there another letter from Lucy Dupree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Allan,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;No doubt you have heard the news that Ryder has
      been forced out of the Gotham Trust. But I have accomplished part of my
      purpose&mdash;Waterman has promised that he will put him on his feet again
      after this trouble is over. In the meantime, I am told to go away. This is
      for the best; you will remember that you yourself urged me to go. Ryder
      cannot see me, because the newspaper reporters are following him so
      closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you not to try to find me. I am hateful in my own sight, and you
      will never see me again. There is one last thing that you can do for me.
      Go to Stanley Ryder and offer him your help&mdash;I mean your advice in
      straightening out his affairs. He has no friends now, and he is in a
      desperate plight. Do this for me. Lucy.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At eight the next morning the train from the Adirondacks arrived, and
      Montague was awakened by his brother at the telephone. &ldquo;Have you seen this
      morning's Despatch?&rdquo; was Oliver's first word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen it,&rdquo; said Montague; &ldquo;but I know what's in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the Trust Company of the Republic?&rdquo; asked Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I was told the story before I telegraphed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my God, man,&rdquo; cried Oliver&mdash;&ldquo;then why aren't you down town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to let my money stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that the institution is sound; and I am not going to leave
      Prentice in the lurch. I telegraphed you, so that you could do as you
      chose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment or two before Oliver could find words to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You might have done a little more&mdash;sent somebody
      down to keep a place in line for me. You're out of your mind, but there's
      no time to talk about it now. Good-by.&rdquo; And so he rang off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague dressed and had his breakfast; in the meantime he glanced over a
      copy of the Despatch, where, in the account of the day's events, he found
      the fatal statements about the Trust Company of the Republic. It was very
      interesting to Montague to read these newspapers and see the picture of
      events which they presented to the public. They all told what they could
      not avoid telling&mdash;that is, the events which were public matters; but
      they never by any chance gave a hint of the reasons for the happenings&mdash;you
      would have supposed that all these upheavals in the banking world were so
      many thunderbolts which had fallen from the heavens above. And each day
      they gave more of their space to insisting that the previous day's
      misfortunes were the last&mdash;that by no chance could there be any more
      thunderbolts to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went down town, he rode one station farther than usual in order to
      pass the Trust Company of the Republic. He found a line of people
      extending halfway round the block, and in the minute that he stood
      watching there were a score or more added to it. Police were patrolling up
      and down&mdash;it was not many hours later that they were compelled to
      adopt the expedient of issuing numbered tickets to those who waited in the
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague walked on toward the front, looking for his brother. But he had
      not gone very far before he gave an exclamation of amazement. He saw a
      short, stout, grey-haired figure, which he recognised, even by its back.
      &ldquo;Major Venable!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major whirled about. &ldquo;Montague!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;My God, you are just
      in time to save my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a chair!&rdquo; gasped the Major, whose purple features seemed about to
      burst with his unwonted exertions. &ldquo;I've been standing here for two hours.
      In another minute more I should have sat down on the sidewalk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can I get a chair?&rdquo; asked Montague, biting his tongue in order to
      repress his amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over on Broadway,&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;Go into one of the stores, and make
      somebody sell you one. Pay anything&mdash;I don't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Montague went back, and entered a leather-goods store, where he saw
      several cane-seated chairs. He was free to laugh then all he pleased; and
      he explained the situation to one of the clerks, who demurred at five
      dollars, but finally consented for ten dollars to take the risk of
      displeasing his employer. For fifty cents more Montague found a boy to
      carry it, and he returned in triumph to his venerable friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never expected to see you in a position like this,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I
      thought you always knew things in advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord, Montague!&rdquo; muttered the other, &ldquo;I've got a quarter of a
      million in this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got about one-fourth as much myself,&rdquo; said Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Major. &ldquo;Then what are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to leave it in,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;I have reason to know that
      that report in the Despatch is simply a blunder, and that the institution
      is sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, man, there'll be a run on it!&rdquo; sputtered the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will, if everybody behaves like you. You don't need your quarter of
      a million to pay for your lunch, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major was too much amazed to find a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put your money in a trust company,&rdquo; the other continued, &ldquo;and you
      know that it only keeps five per cent reserve, and is liable to pay a
      hundred per cent of its deposits. How can you expect it to do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't expect it,&rdquo; said the Major, grimly; &ldquo;I expect to be among the
      five per cent.&rdquo; And he cast his eye up the line, and added, &ldquo;I rather
      think I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague went on ahead, and found his brother, with only about a score of
      people ahead of him. Apparently not many of the depositors of the Trust
      Company read their newspapers before eight o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want a chair, too?&rdquo; asked Montague. &ldquo;I just got one for the
      Major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he here, too?&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver. &ldquo;Good Heavens! No, I don't want a
      chair,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I'll get through early. But, Allan, tell me&mdash;what
      in the world is the matter? Do you really mean that your money is still in
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's here,&rdquo; the other answered. &ldquo;There's no use arguing about it&mdash;come
      over to the office when you get your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got the train just by half a minute,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;Poor Bertie
      Stuyvesant didn't get up in time, and he's coming on a special&mdash;he's
      got about three hundred thousand in here. It was to pay for his new
      yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess some of the yacht-makers won't be quite so busy from now on,&rdquo;
       remarked the other, as he moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon he heard the story of how General Prentice, as a director
      of the Gotham Trust, had voted that the institution should not close its
      doors, and then, as president of the Trust Company of the Republic, had
      sent over and cashed a check for a million dollars. None of the newspapers
      printed that story, but it ran from mouth to mouth, and was soon the jest
      of the whole city. Men said that it was this act of treachery which had
      taken the heart out of the Gotham Trust Company directors, and led to the
      closing of its doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the beginning of the panic as Montague saw it. It had all worked
      out beautifully, according to the schedule. The stock market was falling
      to pieces&mdash;some of the leading stocks were falling several points
      between transactions, and Wyman and Hegan and the Oil and Steel people
      were hammering the market and getting ready for the killing. And at the
      same time, representatives of Waterman in Washington were interviewing the
      President, and setting before him the desperate plight of the Mississippi
      Steel Company. Already the structure of the country's finances was
      tottering; and here was one more big failure threatening. Realising the
      desperate situation, the Steel Trust was willing to do its part to save
      the country&mdash;it would take over the Mississippi Steel Company,
      provided only that the Government would not interfere. The desired promise
      was given; and so that last of Waterman's purposes was accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one factor in the problem upon which few had reckoned, and
      that was the vast public which furnished all the money for the game&mdash;the
      people to whom dollars were not simply gamblers' chips, but to whom they
      stood for the necessities of life; business men who must have them to pay
      their clerks on Saturday afternoon; working-men who needed them for rent
      and food; helpless widows and orphans to whom they meant safety from
      starvation. These unhappy people had no means of knowing that financial
      institutions, which were perfectly sound and able to pay their depositors,
      might be wrecked deliberately in a gamblers' game. When they heard that
      banks were tottering, and were being besieged for money, they concluded
      that there must be real danger&mdash;that the long-predicted crash must be
      at hand. They descended upon Wall Street in hordes&mdash;the whole
      financial district was packed with terrified crowds, and squads of
      policemen rode through upon horseback in order to keep open the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody asked for a dollar,&rdquo; was the way one banker phrased it. Wall
      Street had been doing business with pieces of paper; and now someone asked
      for a dollar, and it was discovered that the dollar had been mislaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an experience for which the captains of finance were not entirely
      prepared; they had forgotten the public. It was like some great convulsion
      of nature, which made mockery of all the powers of men, and left the
      beholder dazed and terrified. In Wall Street men stood as if in a valley,
      and saw far up above them the starting of an avalanche; they stood
      fascinated with horror, and watched it gathering headway; saw the clouds
      of dust rising up, and heard the roar of it swelling, and realised that it
      was a matter of only a second or two before it would be upon them and
      sweep them to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines of people before the Gotham Trust and the Trust Company of the
      Republic were now blocks in length; and every hour one heard of runs upon
      new institutions. There were women wringing their hands and crying in
      nervous excitement; there were old people, scarcely able to totter; there
      were people who had risen from sick-beds, and who stood all through the
      day and night, shivering in the keen October winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Runs had begun on the savings banks also; over on the East Side the alarm
      had reached the ignorant foreign population. It had spread with the speed
      of lightning all over the country; already there were reports of runs in
      other cities, and from thousands and tens of thousands of banks in East
      and South and West came demands upon the Metropolis for money. And there
      was no money anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the masters of the Banking Trust realised to their annoyance that
      the monster which they had turned loose might get beyond their control.
      Runs were beginning upon institutions in which they themselves were
      concerned. In the face of madness such as this, even the twenty-five per
      cent reserves of the national banks would not be sufficient. The moving of
      the cotton and grain crops had taken hundreds of millions from New York;
      and there was no money to be got by any chance from abroad. Everywhere
      they turned, they faced this appalling scarcity of money; nothing could be
      sold, no money could be borrowed. The few who had succeeded in getting
      their cash were renting safe-deposit boxes and hiding the actual coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, all their purposes having been accomplished, the bankers set to
      work to stem the tide. Frantic telegrams were sent to Washington, and the
      Secretary of the Treasury deposited six million dollars in the national
      banks of the Metropolis, and then came on himself to consult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men turned to Dan Waterman, who was everywhere recognised as the master of
      the banking world. The rivalry of the different factions ceased in the
      presence of this peril; and Waterman became suddenly a king, with
      practically absolute control of the resources of every bank in the city.
      Even the Government placed itself in his hands; the Secretary of the
      Treasury became one of his clerks, and bank presidents and financiers came
      crowding into his office like panic-stricken children. Even the proudest
      and most defiant men, like Wyman and Hegan, took his orders and listened
      humbly to his tirades.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these events were public history, and one might follow them day by day
      in the newspapers. Waterman's earlier acts had been planned and carried
      out in darkness. No one knew, no one had the faintest suspicion. But now
      newspaper reporters attended the conferences and trailed Waterman about
      wherever he went, and the public was invited to the wonderful spectacle of
      this battle-worn veteran, rousing himself for one last desperate campaign
      and saving the honour and credit of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public hung upon his lightest word, praying for his success. The
      Secretary of the Treasury sat in the Sub-Treasury building near his
      office, and poured out the funds of the Government under his direction.
      Thirty-two million dollars in all were thus placed with the national
      banks; and from all these institutions Waterman drew the funds which he
      poured into the vaults of the imperilled banks and trust companies. It was
      a time when one man's peril was every man's, and none might stand alone.
      And Waterman was a despot, imperious and terrible. &ldquo;I have taken care of
      my bank,&rdquo; said one president; &ldquo;and I intend to shut myself up in it and
      wait until the storm is over.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; Waterman retorted, &ldquo;I will
      build a wall around you, and you will never get out of it again!&rdquo; And so
      the banker contributed the necessary number of millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight centred around the imperilled Trust Company of the Republic. It
      was recognised by everyone that if Prentice's institution went down, it
      would mean defeat. Longer and longer grew the line of waiting depositors;
      the vaults were nearly empty. The cashiers adopted the expedient of paying
      very slowly&mdash;they would take half an hour or more to investigate a
      single check; and thus they kept going until more money arrived. The
      savings banks of the city agreed unanimously to close their doors,
      availing themselves of their legal right to demand sixty days before
      paying. The national banks resorted to the expedient of paying with
      clearing-house certificates. The newspapers preached confidence and
      cheered the public&mdash;even the newsboys were silenced, so that their
      shrill cries might no longer increase the public excitement. Groups of
      mounted policemen swept up and down the streets, keeping the crowds upon
      the move.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so at last came the fateful Thursday, the climax of the panic. A pall
      seemed to have fallen upon Wall Street. Men ran here and there, bareheaded
      and pale with fright. Upon the floor of the Stock Exchange men held their
      breath. The market was falling to pieces. All sales had stopped; one might
      quote any price one chose, for it was impossible to borrow a dollar.
      Interest rates had gone to one hundred and fifty per cent to two hundred
      per cent; a man might have offered a thousand per cent for a large sum and
      not obtained it. The brokers stood about, gazing at each other in utter
      despair. Such an hour had never before been known.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the funds of the Government had been withheld from the
      Exchange. The Government must not help the gamblers, everyone insisted.
      But now had come the moment when it seemed that the Exchange must be
      closed. Thousands of firms would be ruined, the business of the country
      would be paralysed. There came word that the Pittsburg Exchange had
      closed. So once more the terrified magnates crowded into Waterman's
      office. Once more the funds of the Government were poured into the banks;
      and from the banks they came to Waterman; and within a few minutes after
      the crisis had developed, the announcement was made that Dan Waterman
      would lend twenty-five million dollars at ten per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the peril was averted. Brokers upon the floor wept for joy, and cheers
      rang through all the Street. A mob of men gathered in front of Waterman's
      office, singing a chorus of adulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these events Montague followed day by day. He was passing through Wall
      Street that Thursday afternoon, and he heard the crowds singing. He turned
      away, bitter and sick at heart. Could a more tragic piece of irony have
      been imagined than this&mdash;that the man, who of all men had been
      responsible for this terrible calamity, should be heralded before the
      whole country as the one who averted it! Could there have been a more
      appalling illustration of the way in which the masters of the Metropolis
      were wont to hoodwink its blind and helpless population?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one man to whom Montague could vent his feelings; only one
      man besides himself who knew the real truth. Montague got the habit, when
      he left his work, of stopping at the Express building, and listening for a
      few minutes to the grumbling of Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates would have each day's news fresh from the inside; not only the
      things which would be printed on the morrow, but the things which would
      never be printed anywhere. And he and Montague would feed the fires of
      each other's rage. One day it would be one of the Express's own
      editorials, in which it was pointed out that the intemperate speeches and
      reckless policies of the President were now bearing their natural fruit;
      another day it would be a letter from a prominent clergyman, naming
      Waterman as the President's successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men were beside themselves with wonder at the generosity of Waterman in
      lending twenty-five millions at ten per cent. But it was not his own money&mdash;it
      was the money of the national banks which he was lending; and this was
      money which the national banks had got from the Government, and for which
      they paid the Government no interest at all. There was never any graft in
      the world so easy as the national bank graft, declared Bates. These smooth
      gentlemen got the people's money to build their institutions. They got the
      Government to deposit money with them, and they paid the Government
      nothing, and charged the people interest for it. They had the privilege of
      issuing a few hundred millions of bank-notes, and they charged interest
      for these and paid the Government nothing. And then, to cap the climax,
      they used their profits to buy up the Government! They filled the Treasury
      Department with their people, and when they got into trouble, the
      Sub-Treasury was emptied into their vaults. And in the face of all this,
      the people agitated for postal savings banks, and couldn't get them. In
      other countries the people had banks where they could put their money with
      absolute certainty; for no one had ever known such a thing as a run upon a
      postal bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Bates, &ldquo;it seems almost as if our people were
      hypnotised. You saw all this life insurance scandal, Mr. Montague; and
      there's one simple and obvious remedy for all the evils&mdash;if we had
      Government life insurance, it could never fail, and there'd be no surplus
      for Wall Street gamblers. It sounds almost incredible&mdash;but do you
      know, I followed that agitation as I don't believe any other man in this
      country followed it&mdash;and from first to last I don't believe that one
      single suggestion of that remedy was ever made in print!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A startled look had come upon Montague's face as he listened. &ldquo;I don't
      believe I ever thought of it myself!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bates shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So it goes.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montague had taken a couple of days to think over Lucy's last request. It
      was a difficult commission; but he made up his mind at last that he would
      make the attempt. He went up to Ryder's home and presented his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ryder is very much occupied, sir&mdash;&rdquo; began the butler,
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is important,&rdquo; said Montague. &ldquo;Take him the card, please.&rdquo; He waited
      in the palatial entrance-hall, decorated with ceilings which had been
      imported intact from old Italian palaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the butler returned. &ldquo;Mr. Ryder says will you please see him
      upstairs, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague entered the elevator, and was taken to Ryder's private
      apartments. In the midst of the drawing-room was a great library table,
      covered with a mass of papers; and in a chair in front of it sat Ryder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague had never seen such dreadful suffering upon a human countenance.
      The exquisite man of fashion had grown old in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; he began, when they were alone, &ldquo;I received a letter from
      Mrs. Taylor, asking me to come to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ryder. &ldquo;It was like her; and it is very good of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any way that I can be of assistance,&rdquo; the other began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ryder shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could give you my help in straightening out your own affairs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are beyond all help,&rdquo; said Ryder. &ldquo;I have nothing to begin on&mdash;I
      have not a dollar in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hardly possible,&rdquo; objected Montague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is literally true!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I have tried every plan&mdash;I
      have been over the thing and over it, until I am almost out of my mind.&rdquo;
       And he glanced about him at the confusion of papers, and leaned his
      forehead in his hands in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps if a fresh mind were to take it up,&rdquo; suggested Montague. &ldquo;It is
      difficult to see how a man of your resources could be left without
      anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything I have is mortgaged,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I have been borrowing
      money right and left. I was counting on profits&mdash;I was counting on
      increases in value. And now see&mdash;everything is wiped out! There is
      not value enough left in anything to cover the loans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, Mr. Ryder, this slump is merely temporary. Values must be
      restored&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be years, it will be years! And in the meantime I shall be forced
      to sell. They have wiped me out&mdash;they have destroyed me! I have not
      even money to live on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague sat for a few moments in thought. &ldquo;Mrs. Taylor wrote me that
      Waterman&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;He had to tell her something, to get
      what he wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose he does what he promised?&rdquo; continued the other. &ldquo;He has done
      it before&mdash;but am I to be one of Dan Waterman's lackeys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. &ldquo;Like John Lawrence,&rdquo; continued Ryder, in a low
      voice. &ldquo;Have you heard of Lawrence? He was a banker&mdash;one of the
      oldest in the city. And Waterman gave him an order, and he defied him.
      Then he broke him; took away every dollar he owned. And the man came to
      him on his knees. 'I've taught you who is your master,' said Waterman.
      'Now here's your money.' And now Lawrence fawns on him, and he's got rich
      and fat. But all his bank exists for is to lend money when Waterman is
      floating a merger, and call it in when he is buying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague could think of nothing to reply to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ryder,&rdquo; he began at last, &ldquo;I cannot be of much use to you now,
      because I haven't the facts. All I can tell you is that I am at your
      disposal. I will give you my best efforts, if you will let me. That is all
      I can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ryder looked up, the light shining on his white, wan face. &ldquo;Thank you,
      Mr. Montague,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is very good of you. It is a help, at least,
      to hear a word of sympathy. I&mdash;I will let you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Montague, rising. He put out his hand, and Ryder took it
      tremblingly. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other turned and went out. He went down the great staircase by
      himself. At the foot he passed the butler, carrying a tray with some
      coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped the man. &ldquo;Mr. Ryder ought not to be left alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
      should have his physician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; began the other, and then stopped short. From the floor above
      a pistol shot rang out and echoed through the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; gasped the butler, staggering backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He half dropped and half set the tray upon a chair, and ran wildly up the
      steps. Montague stood for a moment or two as if turned to stone. He saw
      another servant run out of the dining-room and up the stairs. Then, with a
      sudden impulse, he turned and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be of no use,&rdquo; he thought to himself; &ldquo;I should only drag Lucy's
      name into it.&rdquo; And he opened the door, and went quietly down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the newspapers the next morning he read that Stanley Ryder had shot
      himself in the body, and was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that same morning the newspapers in Denver, Colorado, told of the
      suicide of a mysterious woman, a stranger, who had gone to a room in one
      of the hotels and taken poison. She was very beautiful; it was surmised
      that she must be an actress. But she had left not a scrap of paper or a
      clew of any sort by which she could be identified. The newspapers printed
      her photograph; but Montague did not see the Denver newspapers, and so to
      the day of his death he never knew what had been the fate of Lucy Dupree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panic was stopped, but the business of the country lay in ruins. For a
      week its financial heart had ceased to beat, and through all the arteries
      of commerce, and every smallest capillary, there was stagnation. Hundreds
      of firms had failed, and the mills and factories by the thousands were
      closing down. There were millions of men out of work. Throughout the
      summer the railroads had been congested with traffic, and now there were a
      quarter of a million freight cars laid by. Everywhere were poverty and
      suffering; it was as if a gigantic tidal wave of distress had started from
      the Metropolis and rolled over the continent. Even the oceans had not
      stopped it; it had gone on to England and Germany&mdash;it had been felt
      even in South America and Japan.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, while Montague was still trembling with the pain of his
      experience, he was walking up the Avenue, and he met Laura Hegan coming
      from a shop to her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Montague,&rdquo; she exclaimed, and stopped with a frank smile of greeting.
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you have been very busy these terrible days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been more busy observing than doing,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is Alice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is well. I suppose you have heard that she is engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Hegan. &ldquo;Harry told me the first thing. I was perfectly
      delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going up town?&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Get in and drive with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He entered the carriage, and they joined the procession up the Avenue.
      They talked for a few minutes, then suddenly Miss Hegan said, &ldquo;Won't you
      and Alice come to dinner with us some evening this week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montague did not answer for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father is home now,&rdquo; Miss Hegan continued. &ldquo;We should like so much to
      have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat staring in front of him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at last, in a low voice. &ldquo;I
      would rather not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner, even more than his words, struck his companion. She glanced at
      him in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she began, and stopped. There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hegan,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I might make conventional excuses. I might
      say that I have engagements; that I am very busy. Ordinarily one does not
      find it worth while to tell the truth in this social world of ours. But
      somehow I feel impelled to deal frankly with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not look at her. Her eyes were fixed upon him in wonder. &ldquo;What is
      it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he replied, &ldquo;I would rather not meet your father again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Has anything happened between you and father?&rdquo; she exclaimed in
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I have not seen your father since I had lunch with you
      in Newport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment. &ldquo;Miss Hegan,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have had a painful
      experience in this panic. I have lived through it in a very dreadful way.
      I cannot get over it&mdash;I cannot get the images of suffering out of my
      mind. It is a very real and a very awful thing to me&mdash;this wrecking
      of the lives of tens of thousands of people. And so I am hardly fitted for
      the amenities of social life just at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father!&rdquo; gasped she. &ldquo;What has he to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is one of the men who were responsible for
      that panic. He helped to make it; and he profited by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started forward, clenching her hands and staring at him wildly. &ldquo;Mr.
      Montague!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. He could hear her breath coming quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know very much about my father's affairs,&rdquo; she began, at last.
      &ldquo;I cannot reply to what you say. It is very dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please understand me, Miss Hegan,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have no right to force
      such thoughts upon you; and perhaps I have made a mistake&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have preferred that you should tell me the truth,&rdquo; she said
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believed that you would,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That was why I spoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was what he did so very dreadful?&rdquo; asked the girl, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would prefer not to answer,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I cannot judge your father. I am
      simply trying to protect myself. I'm afraid of the grip of this world upon
      me. I have followed the careers of so many men, one after another. They
      come into it, and it lays hold of them, and before they know it, they
      become corrupt. What I have seen here in the Metropolis has filled me with
      dismay, almost with terror. Every fibre of me cries out against it; and I
      mean to fight it&mdash;to fight it all my life. And so I do not care to
      make terms with it socially. When I have seen a man doing what I believe
      to be a dreadful wrong, I cannot go to his home, and shake his hand, and
      smile, and exchange the commonplaces of life with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time before Miss Hegan replied. Her voice was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Montague,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must not think that I have not been
      troubled by these things. But what can one do? What is the remedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I wish that I did know. I can only tell you
      this, that I do not intend to rest until I have found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied: &ldquo;I am going into politics. I am going to try to teach the
      people.&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
